Trump Called Michael Cohen as Their Lawyers Went to Court Over Seized Trump Documents,"The uncertainty around what was taken has heightened the unease around Mr. Trump, whose lawyers had projected confidence in their dealings with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, but were caught flat-footed by the extraordinary raids on Mr. Cohen. The lawyers fear that Mr. Cohen will not be forthcoming about what was in his files, leaving them girding for the unknown.

A hurriedly scheduled court appearance in Manhattan on Friday reflected that worry. The seized documents could shed light on the president’s relationship with Mr. Cohen who has helped steer him through some of his thorniest personal and business dilemmas. Joanna C. Hendon, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, asked a federal judge to temporarily prohibit the Justice Department from reviewing those materials until the matter can be litigated.

“Those searches have been executed and the evidence is locked down. I’m not trying to delay,” Ms. Hendon said. “I’m just trying to ensure that it’s done scrupulously.”

Mr. Cohen’s lawyers have called the raids of his offices and hotel room an overreach of the law, and the president has said that the attorney-client privilege is dead because of the action.

Mr. Cohen wants his lawyers to be able to review the files and withhold privileged material before prosecutors can see them. As an alternative, he asked that an independent lawyer be allowed to review the files first, which prosecutors said would delay the investigation. Prosecutors argued in their court filing that the request by Mr. Cohen’s lawyer “belies the true intent of his motion: To delay the case” and “deprive” prosecutors of evidence. Judge Kimba M. Wood of United States District Court postponed any decision until a follow-up hearing Monday.

Federal agents seized documents that dated back years, some of which are related to payments to two women who have said they had affairs with Mr. Trump. Other documents seized included information about the role of The National Enquirer in silencing one of the women, people briefed on the investigation have said.

The warrant sought all documents, including emails between Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump, related to Mr. Cohen’s efforts to suppress negative publicity ahead of the 2016 election.

Communications between lawyers and their clients are normally off limits to prosecutors but there are exceptions, including when the materials are considered part of an ongoing crime.

The raid on Mr. Cohen surprised and angered the president, who has been frustrated with the ongoing special counsel investigation into Russia’s 2016 election interference, the Kremlin’s possible coordination with Trump associates and whether the president has been deliberately trying to obstruct those inquiries. On Monday, Mr. Trump called the raid an “attack on our country in a true sense.”

Federal agents in New York were looking for information about Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who claims she had a nearly yearlong affair with Mr. Trump shortly after the birth of his youngest son in 2006. American Media Inc., which owns the National Enquirer, paid Ms. McDougal $150,000. The chief executive of America Media Inc. is a friend of Mr. Trump’s.

Agents were also searching Mr. Cohen’s office and hotel room for information related to Stephanie Clifford, better known as Stormy Daniels, a pornographic film actress. Ms. Clifford has said she had sex with Mr. Trump while he was married. Mr. Cohen has acknowledged that he paid Ms. Clifford $130,000 as part of a nondisclosure agreement to secure her silence days before the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Trump recently told reporters he knew nothing about the agreement.

The seized records also include communications between Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen, who joined Mr. Trump’s company, the Trump Organization, in 2006, which would most likely require a special team of agents to review because conversations between lawyers and clients are protected from scrutiny in most instances.

Searching a law office is one of the most sensitive — and most heavily reviewed — activities the Justice Department conducts. It is rare to seek documents from lawyers in any case, but doing so by search rather than subpoena is unusually aggressive and is typically reserved for cases when prosecutors believe that the lawyer would conceal or destroy evidence if asked for it."
R.N.C. Official Who Agreed to Pay Playboy Model $1.6 Million Resigns,"Photo

A major donor with close ties to the White House resigned on Friday as deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee after the revelation that he had agreed to pay $1.6 million to a former Playboy model who became pregnant during an affair.

The deal was arranged by President Trump’s personal lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen.

Under the terms of the deal, the Republican donor, Elliott Broidy, would pay the woman in installments over the course of two years, and in return, she would agree to stay silent about their relationship, two people with knowledge of the arrangement told The New York Times. The deal was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

The lawyer for the woman, Keith M. Davidson, also represented two women who were paid during the presidential campaign for their silence about alleged affairs with Mr. Trump — a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, who sold the rights to her story to American Media Inc., and Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic actress known as Stormy Daniels, who received a payment of $130,000 that Mr. Cohen said came out of his own pocket.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation raided Mr. Cohen’s Manhattan office and hotel room on Monday seeking business records, emails and documents relating to those two agreements, as well as Mr. Cohen’s work for the Trump Organization and efforts to suppress negative information about the president.

It is unclear whether the F.B.I. has scrutinized Mr. Davidson.

The deal involving Mr. Broidy was not known to be a subject of the investigation.

In his statement, Mr. Broidy apologized to his wife and family while acknowledging that he had had an affair with the woman. He said that “she alone decided that she did not want to continue with the pregnancy and I offered to help her financially during this difficult period.”"
Trump Calls Comey ‘Untruthful Slime Ball’ as Book Details Released,"Mr. Comey will have an opportunity to respond during what is expected to be a long book tour in which he will do many interviews. His first major interview, with ABC News, is scheduled to be broadcast Sunday night, though the network began airing clips Friday morning after the book leaked out.

In the meantime, Mr. Comey is likely to receive a somewhat muted defense from some Democrats, who are still angry about the way he handled the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server. While they cheer on his fight with Mr. Trump, they argue Mr. Comey should not have made public the email probe the way he did.

“He let his own ego get in the way, and it put him in charge of fate that was not his decision to act on,” said Jennifer Palmieri, a senior adviser to Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. “I don’t think he had partisan motivations. But there’s a lot of people I know who don’t agree with me on that.”

Anger toward Mr. Comey from Democrats cascaded across social media sites on Friday. Ms. Palmieri said she would urge Democrats not to join Mr. Trump in piling on Mr. Comey, even though she admitted there is “a lot of resentment” toward him.

“I don’t agree that he’s an untruthful slimeball,” she said, adding that Democrats should not help the president undermine Mr. Comey’s credibility. “That’s not responsible or productive.”

Nevertheless, the insult slinging has officially begun, and neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Comey minced his words.

Mr. Trump’s face appeared “slightly orange, with bright white half-moons under his eyes where I assumed he placed small tanning goggles,” Mr. Comey writes.

Mr. Comey is “weak,” and was a “terrible Director,” Mr. Trump said.

Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey in May of last year, a decision that eventually led to the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Russia’s 2016 election meddling and whether Mr. Trump has deliberately tried to obstruct the investigation.

The former F.B.I. chief’s much-anticipated 304-page memoir is scheduled to be released next week. It is the first major memoir by one of the key characters in the Trump administration.

In his book, Mr. Comey reflects on his days as a mob prosecutor in New York and compares Mr. Trump to a mafia boss: “The silent circle of assent. The boss in complete control. The loyalty oaths. The us-versus-them worldview. The lying about all things, large and small, in service to some code of loyalty that put the organization above morality and above the truth.”

[Read our review of Mr. Comey’s memoir.]

Mr. Comey also describes a January 2017 dinner where he said Mr. Trump asked him for a loyalty pledge, an episode that was reported by multiple news organizations last year.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Comey have previously exchanged angry tweets, but the president’s posts on Friday morning were the first on the matter since details of the book were released.

Republican allies of Mr. Trump’s have planned a counteroffensive and created a “Lyin’ Comey” website aimed at discrediting the former F.B.I. chief.

And Fox News, the president’s preferred TV news network, plans to air a special called “The Trial of James Comey” Sunday night. The Fox program is scheduled to air on The Next Revolution with Steve Hilton at 9 p.m.

The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, tweeted early Friday that Mr. Comey “has no credibility.”

Kellyanne Conway, one of Mr. Trump’s advisers, hit on the same theme.

“We find that Mr. Comey has a revisionist view of history and seems like a disgruntled ex-employee,” Ms. Conway said on Friday. “After all, he was fired.”"
Comey’s Memoir Offers Visceral Details on a President ‘Untethered to Truth’,"The 304-page memoir by Mr. Comey is the only firsthand, insider account to emerge so far by a former Trump official describing what it was like to work in the chaotic early days of the administration. In it, Mr. Comey, a veteran law enforcement agent, writes unsparingly about Mr. Trump, calling him a tempestuous president whose connection to honesty was tenuous at best.

“This president is unethical, and untethered to truth and institutional values,” Mr. Comey writes in the book, saying his service to Mr. Trump recalled for him the days when he investigated the mob in New York. “The silent circle of assent. The boss in complete control. The loyalty oaths. The us-versus-them worldview. The lying about all things, large and small, in service to some code of loyalty that put the organization above morality and above the truth.”

With the book’s release set for next week, Mr. Comey is planning a media blitz, beginning with an intensely hyped interview with ABC News that is set to air Sunday night. Republican allies of Mr. Trump’s have already set in motion a counteroffensive, creating a “Lyin’ Comey” website aimed at discrediting the former F.B.I. chief.

Mr. Comey’s book does not include dramatic new revelations about the Russia investigation itself, which is continuing. But Mr. Comey does not pull punches as he provides rigorous detail — pulled from his contemporaneous notes — about his charged interactions with Mr. Trump during the transition and in the White House.

In a memoir laced with excruciating detail, Mr. Comey — who is 6 feet 8 inches tall — describes meeting Mr. Trump for the first time, noting that the soon-to-be-president, at 6 feet 3 inches tall, appeared shorter than he had assumed.

“His face appeared slightly orange, with bright white half-moons under his eyes where I assumed he placed small tanning goggles,” Mr. Comey writes of his impressions during that first in-person session. He said Mr. Trump had “impressively coifed, bright blond hair, which upon close inspection looked to be all his.”

The book also serves as a platform for Mr. Comey to once again defend his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the decisions that for a time made him one of the most despised figures among political liberals and other supporters of Mrs. Clinton.

[Read our review of Mr. Comey’s memoir.]

However, Mr. Comey acknowledges that he thought Mrs. Clinton would win the presidency and said it is “entirely possible” that he decided to reveal that the email investigation had started up again 11 days before the election because he was primarily concerned that if he concealed the renewed investigation, it would make her an “illegitimate president.”

Would he have made a different decision if Mr. Trump had been ahead in the polls? “I don’t know,” Mr. Comey concedes.

The book is a personal memoir more than a direct attack on Mr. Trump, the 45th president, and many of the chapters do not mention him. Mr. Comey describes his upbringing and the path that led him to the Justice Department and the F.B.I.

And he retells stories from his days working for President George W. Bush.

He offers less-than-flattering portraits of Mr. Bush’s political and diplomatic advisers, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and David S. Addington, a top adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney. From their point of view, he says, “The war on terrorism justified stretching, if not breaking, the written law.”

He writes more fondly of his time serving President Barack Obama, describing a scene in the Oval Office just after the 2016 election when Mr. Obama said he remained convinced of Mr. Comey’s integrity and abilities despite the hatred coming from people who blamed him for Mrs. Clinton’s loss.

“I want you to know that nothing — nothing — has happened in the last year to change my view,” Mr. Obama told him. “Boy were those words I needed to hear,” Mr. Comey says he replied.

Mr. Comey is less gentle with former Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, whom he skewers for suggesting that he refer to the Clinton email case as “a matter,” not an “investigation.” He says that he responded to her, “The F.B.I. didn’t do matters.”

But the book, which soared to the top of best-seller lists well before its actual release, has not prompted intense interest because of Mr. Comey’s efforts to put his spin on the historical record of his life in law enforcement. It is the chapters about Mr. Trump that has Washington on edge and the public keenly interested.

Mr. Comey reveals that after he was fired, he received what he calls “an emotional call” from John F. Kelly, who was then the secretary of homeland security and would go on to become Mr. Trump’s second chief of staff.

During the call, Mr. Kelly said he was “sick” about the firing and intended to quit in protest, Mr. Comey writes, adding: “I urged Kelly not to do that, arguing that the country needed principled people around this president. Especially this president.”

Mr. Comey has already told some of the stories about Mr. Trump that he writes about in the book, including descriptions of a January 2017 dinner in which the former F.B.I. director says the president sought to extract a loyalty pledge from him.

He describes in detail the moment when he says Mr. Trump raised the issue of Michael T. Flynn, the onetime national security adviser who had been fired for lying. “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,” Mr. Trump said, according to Mr. Comey.

“It was very concerning,” Mr. Comey writes.

But in the book, Mr. Comey goes much further than he has before in offering his assessment of the president’s character. Describing one exchange with Mr. Trump and Reince Priebus, then the chief of staff, Mr. Comey comments on the president’s assertions of what “everyone thinks” and what is “obviously true.”

“I could see how easily everyone in the room could become a co-conspirator to his preferred set of facts, or delusions,” Mr. Comey writes about the president. He says he watched Mr. Trump build “a cocoon of alternative reality” around the people in the room.

Mr. Comey devotes a good part of the book to his worry about the damage that Mr. Trump and his presidency are doing to the country’s future.

“We are experiencing a dangerous time in our country,” he writes, “with a political environment where basic facts are disputed, fundamental truth is questioned, lying is normalized and unethical behavior is ignored, excused or rewarded.”"
Former F.B.I. Deputy Director Is Faulted in Scathing Inspector General Report,"Photo

WASHINGTON — The Justice Department inspector general delivered to Congress on Friday a highly critical report that accused Andrew G. McCabe, the former F.B.I. deputy director, of repeatedly misleading investigators.

The inspector general said that when investigators asked whether he had instructed aides to provide information in October 2016 to a reporter with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. McCabe said he did not authorize the disclosure and did not know who did.

But Mr. McCabe did approve the F.B.I.’s contact with the reporter, according to the review.

The newspaper article delved into a dispute between F.B.I. and Justice Department officials over how to proceed in an investigation into the financial dealings of the Clinton family’s foundation. It revealed a sensitive meeting during which Justice Department officials declined to authorize subpoenas or grand jury activity.

The inspector general also concluded that Mr. McCabe’s disclosure of the existence of the ongoing investigation in the manner described in the report violated media policy of the F.B.I. and Justice Department and constituted misconduct.

In a statement, Mr. McCabe said that he had full authorization to share this information with the media. Mr. McCabe also said that he did not intentionally mislead investigators.

The report, written by the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, was delivered to Congress and was expected to be released publicly later in the day."
U.S. Says Syria Has Used Chemical Weapons at Least 50 Times During War,"“Our president has not yet made a decision about possible action in Syria,” Ms. Haley told the council. “But should the United States and our allies decide to act in Syria, it will be in defense of a principle on which we all agree.”

The Russian ambassador, Vasily A. Nebenzya, accused the United States and its allies of reckless Middle East warmongering by threatening Syria with military force.

Mr. Nebenzya also said there was no confirmed evidence that chemical weapons had been used in the April 7 Douma attack, and that the United States and its allies had “demonstrated they have no interest in an investigation,” although international chemical weapons inspectors have been sent to Syria to conduct an inquiry.

The Russian envoy also asserted that Russia, Mr. Assad’s biggest ally, had done far more than the West to achieve peace in the Syria conflict. He accused Washington of having adopted “a categorical policy to unleash military force against Syria.”

Mr. Trump’s threats of a strike on Mr. Assad’s forces, the Russian envoy said, were “unworthy of a permanent member of the Security Council.”

Ms. Haley said she was incredulous at Mr. Nebenzya’s defense of the Syrian government and his overall portrayal of events. “I’m in awe of how you say what you say with a straight face,” she told the Russian ambassador.

Ms. Haley called the use of chemical weapons in Syria “a violation of all standards of morality.”

Referring to the Douma assault, Ms. Haley said: “We know who did this. Our allies know who did this. Russia can complain all it wants about fake news, but no one is buying its lies and its cover-ups.”

The number of confirmed chemical weapons assaults in the Syria conflict — and who was responsible for them — is one of the most contentious issues.

In 2015 the Security Council established a panel, the Joint Investigative Mechanism, to determine who was carrying out such attacks. It found that Mr. Assad’s forces had conducted at least four, in April 2014, March 2015, March 2016 and April 2017, and that the Islamic State had conducted two, in August 2015 and September 2016.

The panel was disbanded last November after Russia disputed its findings of Syrian government responsibility. The council has been unable to agree on a replacement.

Another panel, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, established by the United Nations Human Rights Council, has asserted that at least 34 chemical weapons assaults had been committed, by various sides in the conflict, as of January. Human Rights Watch, based on information from seven sources, has put the number at 85 between 2013 and February of this year.

Mr. Assad and his allies, Russia and Iran, have denied that Syrian government forces carried out any chemical weapons attacks, including the reported assault in Douma.

Political analysts said that regardless of the number of attacks, Ms. Haley’s assertions appeared to be part of a broader Western effort to create the basis for a military strike on Mr. Assad’s forces.

“All of this points to an established pattern by the Syrian regime in the conflict,” said Andrew J. Tabler, a Syria scholar at the Washington Institute For Near East Policy. “The justification for a strike is going to be based on this pattern, not just this incident.”

Trump administration officials worked on Friday to come up with a strategy for what to do in the event that an American-led military strike against the Syrian government’s suspected chemical weapons facilities and its airfields sparks a retaliation from Russia and Iran.

The White House scheduled another meeting Friday afternoon of the president’s top national security advisers, as American officials and their allies in Britain and France, who are expected to join any strike, grappled with how to handle concerns expressed by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis about having a Day 2 strategy ready.

American military officials expressed concern during a video conference call about Moscow’s possible reaction to a strike on Syrian facilities — particularly in light of Russian threats to shoot down incoming cruise missiles. During the call, officials also said that it was imperative to take steps to protect American naval destroyers from Russian counterattacks.

One destroyer, the Donald Cook, is in the Mediterranean and another, the Porter, has been heading to region. Both could take part in a strike, as a launch for Tomahawk cruise missiles.

In addition to preparing for a military counterattack, Mr. Mattis has also said that it is important to prepare for a post-strike propaganda campaign by Syria, Russia and Iran. In particular, Defense Department officials want to be able to present convincing evidence that Mr. Assad’s forces indeed used chemical arms in the Douma assault."
Most Chemical Attacks in Syria Get Little Attention. Here Are 34 Confirmed Cases.,"A suspected chemical attack that killed dozens of Syrians in Douma, a rebel-held town near Damascus, drew promises of retaliation from President Trump days after he instructed his military commanders to quickly end American involvement in Syria.

Douma, April 7, 2018 Eastern Ghouta, Jan. 22, 2018 Khan Sheikhoun, April 4, 2017 Aleppo, Dec. 10, 2016 Ain Tarma, Aug. 29, 2013 Eastern Ghouta, Aug. 21, 2013 Clockwise from top left: Syrian Civil Defense White Helmets, via Associated Press; Mohammed Badra/European Pressphoto Agency; Ammar Abdullah/Reuters; Shaam News Network, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images; Reuters; Ghirh Sy/European Pressphoto Agency

But if chemical weapons were used in the attack — which Mr. Trump blamed on the Syrian government as well as its Russian and Iranian allies — it would be the latest in a string of such attacks in Syria in the last five years. Syria, Russia and Iran all denied that the Syrian government used chemical weapons.

The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic says it has confirmed at least 34 chemical attacks since 2013, many of which it said used chlorine or sarin, a nerve agent, and were conducted by the Syrian government. The commission, which is currently investigating the attack on Douma, is an independent body established by the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate human rights violations in Syria.

It is likely that there have been more than these 34 confirmed chemical attacks in Syria. Rolando Gomez, a spokesman for the United Nations Human Rights Council, said that the commission was unable to verify reports of chemical attacks in 2015 because of a lack of access during that time.

Human Rights Watch has reported that there have been 85 chemical attacks since 2013, based on its analysis of reports verified by various sources, including United Nations investigations and Amnesty International.

And the American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, accused the Syrian government on Friday of using chemical weapons at least 50 times since 2011.

“Syria’s widespread use of chemical weapons against civilians is relatively unusual,” Emma Ashford, a research fellow with the Cato Institute, said in an email. “Chemical weapons are far more effective as a tool of terror than as a battlefield weapon,” she added.

The use of chemical weapons in Syria has drawn widespread condemnation and media coverage since an Aug. 2013 sarin attack in Ghouta killed 1,400 people. Less than a month later, the Syrian government signed the Chemical Weapons Convention under pressure from the United Nations Security Council. President Barack Obama was criticized at the time for not directly retaliating militarily even after he had drawn a “red line” around chemical weapons use.

Then, in April 2017, sarin was used again in an attack on Khan Sheikhoun, in northern Syria, that killed more than 80 civilians. Mr. Trump ordered missile strikes on a Syrian air base in response and, since then, “there haven't been reliable or verified reports of the Syrian government again employing sarin gas,” Sam Heller, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, said in an email.

But neither Mr. Obama’s diplomatic approach nor Mr. Trump’s strikes worked to stop Syria’s use of chemical weapons. According to the commission, the Syrian government has continued to use chlorine as a weapon, seemingly without consequence. (Chlorine is much less toxic than sarin and therefore draws less attention.)

If Mr. Trump strikes again as he has promised, “this time the reaction will be larger by all accounts but I don’t think the outcome will be different,” said Aaron Stein, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a think tank.

More than 120,000 civilians have been killed by violence, mostly by conventional, nonchemical weapons, in Syria since 2011, according to the Violations Documentation Center.

“Yet it seems like the international community is primarily concerned with preserving the taboo over the use of chemical weapons, not with civilian deaths,” Ms. Ashford said."
Kudlow Plays ‘Happy Warrior’ Role in Counseling Trump,"His glass-half-full predictions were punctuated with talk of branding and “Kudlowisms,” terms he said he invents and tries to weave into the staff vernacular, like telling the press secretary to make a trade talking point “growthier.”

“This administration and its economic advisers, our goal here is growth — growth, growth, growth, growth — that’s the raison d’être of this administration on domestic policy,” Mr. Kudlow said. “We will rise and fall politically on that.”

It was Mr. Kudlow to whom Mr. Trump turned on Thursday in the Cabinet Room when he blurted out that he was willing to look at rejoining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the sweeping Pacific Rim pact the president pulled out of upon taking office, shocking lawmakers and his own staff.

“Larry, will you get this done?” Mr. Kudlow said the president asked. Mr. Kudlow said he responded that if Mr. Trump did not mind, he would like to involve Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, whose job is to negotiate trade pacts.

Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Kudlow in the past whether he should explore rejoining the pact, he said, adding that he had always encouraged it. But the president’s decision to say so publicly on Thursday was entirely unplanned.

“There’s out of the blue, and there’s, I guess, out of the dark, navy blue,” Mr. Kudlow said. This, he said, was “dark, navy blue.”

But late Thursday, Mr. Trump appeared to reverse course again, tweeting that he would rejoin the pact only if the deal “were substantially better” than the one offered to President Barack Obama.

It was Mr. Kudlow who told the president on Tuesday that he might want to consider publicly praising Mr. Xi’s speech, after days of aggressive rhetoric against China that included a threat of an additional $100 billion in tariffs, on top of the $50 billion already threatened, if China failed to change its trade practices.

At an impromptu meeting in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump seemed to like the idea, and John F. Kelly, the chief of staff, chimed in that he should do it by tweet, “for maximum impact,” Mr. Kudlow recalled. A round of “wordsmithing” ensued with Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, who was also on hand, and Mr. Kudlow said the result was significant.

“It was huge,” Mr. Kudlow said, “because now these two guys are, shall we say, communicating in a positive way.”

There is no evidence that either Mr. Xi’s speech or the presidential tweet has led to any substantive progress in averting the prospect of tariff tit for tat that could have grave consequences for the United States. And Mr. Kudlow — a “free-market guy” who conceded he generally abhors the idea of tariffs — did not claim to have averted a trade war with his advice. But the episode seemed to suggest that Mr. Kudlow, at least for now, has the standing with Mr. Trump to exert his influence at crucial moments on the president’s message.

What is less clear is how he will affect policy.

“People are giving me ‘what-if’ scenarios where everything goes wrong and the sky falls, so the happy warrior says, ‘No, wait a minute,’” Mr. Kudlow said. “I’m not here to say we won’t have tariffs — everything’s on the table in these negotiations — but I am here to say we don’t know yet.”

Mr. Kudlow also did not pretend to know, from moment to moment, whether Mr. Trump’s rhetoric and behavior reflect a president winging it, or one playing out a grand strategy. “Honestly? I don’t know,” he said.

While he said he had read about tensions within the White House economics team, Mr. Kudlow dismissed them cheerfully as “pre-Kudlow.” His predecessor, Gary D. Cohn, a Democrat and former Goldman Sachs executive whom Mr. Trump and his supporters derisively branded a “globalist,” feuded with Peter Navarro, the director of the White House National Trade Council, and a longtime China skeptic.

Mr. Kudlow, a lifelong Republican who advised Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign and helped write his tax cut framework, said he got along well with Mr. Navarro, who was a frequent guest on his television program, even though they disagreed on some policy matters.

Mr. Kudlow said he had broken the ice with Mr. Navarro in a telephone call shortly after he had accepted his White House job.

“One of the first things I did was dial him up and say, ‘Peter, this is your pal, Larry,’” Mr. Kudlow said. “‘Did I ever cut you off on the air?’ And he thought about it.”

Among Mr. Kudlow’s challenges is to keep a president who tends to stray off-script disciplined about promoting the effects of the tax cut enacted last year, which Republicans regard as their best hope of averting crushing losses in this year’s midterm elections.

Mr. Trump went rogue last week in West Virginia, tossing aside prepared remarks about the tax measure that he deemed “boring” and indulging in a lengthy rant against illegal immigration. But he stayed on message Thursday in the Rose Garden, with Mr. Kudlow looking on.

Mr. Kudlow said the president was open to a second round of tax cuts whose details were “not nailed down,” but could include making the personal income tax reductions and some business investment incentives permanent.

“The president looks on it favorably, but nothing’s coming to fruition,” said Mr. Kudlow, who added that he had not focused on the endeavor.

He was similarly vague about the infrastructure initiative, which has languished without a concerted campaign by the White House to make the case for it, and amid bipartisan concerns on Capitol Hill that the $200 billion Mr. Trump proposed over a decade is nowhere near sufficient.

“He’s very keen on it — very keen,” Mr. Kudlow said of the president’s view of the infrastructure plan. “Big priority here. And some people believe there could be a bipartisan deal.”"
"Trump Weighs Return to Trans-Pacific Partnership. Not So Fast, Say Members.","“We’ve got a deal” already, said Steven Ciobo, Australia’s trade minister, who added, “I can’t see that all being thrown open to appease the United States.”

[Read about President Trump’s reversal on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which came at a gathering of politicians from farm states that stand to lose from any trade war with China.]

An early test of the potential for the United States to rejoin could come as soon as next week, when Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister and an ardent champion of the pact, is to meet with Mr. Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla.

Mr. Trump’s renewed interest in the pact depends on whether the United States could strike a better deal than President Barack Obama did, Mr. Trump said in a Thursday night tweet. Still, negotiations with a group of longtime trading partners could hold appeal at a time of increasing tensions with China.

Mr. Trump faces a growing domestic backlash from corporations, farmers and others over fears that he is igniting a trade war with China, the United States’ largest single trading partner. Mr. Trump has warned that he could levy tariffs on $150 billion in Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to threaten retaliatory measures aimed at American soybeans, airplanes and other products.

Negotiating a new pact could take years. Still, rekindling negotiations could make it hard for China to play off the United States against its allies by promising to shift business from one to another if a trade war breaks out. It could be a way to assuage American farmers and businesses hurt by Chinese tariffs by assuring robust markets for American products in countries that signed onto the deal, like Japan, Australia and South Korea. It would give the pact a great deal more heft and help position it as an economic counterweight to China, which increasingly dominates the Asia-Pacific region.

More broadly, it signals to the region that the United States is not giving up on trade, despite Mr. Trump’s sometimes harsh words. Even as officials in other countries expressed skepticism on Friday, they said they would like to hear what Washington has to offer. “Japan would like to listen to the U.S.’s view,” said Mr. Suga, the Japanese official.

The barriers to a new pact are considerable. Many current members of the pact feel they already gave considerable ground to the United States to strike the original deal, particularly in sensitive areas like protections for pharmaceutical companies.

For its part, the Trump administration worries that the partnership will become a zero-tariff backdoor for Chinese goods into the American market. It worries that companies that have moved much of their supply chains to China could make components there, ship them to a member of the Trans-Pacific Partnership for assembly, then sell them in the United States tariff-free. It wants to toughen requirements for how much of the product is made within a participating country, which could make the goods less competitive.

Their worries focus largely on Vietnam, a member of the current version of the pact. It has a large population, and a few big American companies, like Intel, have already invested heavily in setting up factories there that make products practically from scratch. But many other companies that are exporting goods from Vietnam rely heavily on imports from China. Vietnam’s huge garment industry, for example, relies greatly on fabric and accessories imported from China, according to garment manufacturing executives.

Vietnamese officials did not respond to requests for comment on Friday. Frederick Burke, managing partner for Vietnam at the American law firm Baker McKenzie, said that the Vietnamese government is “very aware of and focused on the issue of circumvention” in trade.

Renegotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership may not be quick. Mr. Trump’s trade negotiators already have their hands full this spring trying to complete changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement. They need to decide whether to extend temporary exemptions from the president’s new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Above all, they are locked in a series of increasingly acrimonious trade spats with China.

China is making its own outreach efforts in the meantime. Wang Yi, its foreign minister, will travel to Tokyo on Sunday. China has played up free trade talks with Japan and with South Korea, which is not a member of the partnership.

Sheila A. Smith, a Japan expert at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, said the Trump administration may have realized that it does not have the leverage it thought to renegotiate a new trade deal with Japan, and that embracing the regional pact may be the best fallback.

The Trump administration “could walk right back in with the exact same deal from last year that they walked out of, and claim victory,” said Ms. Smith, who noted that the government of Mr. Abe “has been continuously and quietly encouraging the U.S. administration to take another look” at the pact.

One lingering question would be how China would react. The pact’s rules were designed in part to challenge China by encouraging members to loosen state support of their economies and relax trade rules — steps Beijing would have to take if it hoped to someday join the pact and enjoy its lower trade barriers.

China is not likely to be troubled by a United States move to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership as long as the Trump administration is doing so for strictly trade reasons, said He Weiwen, a former Commerce Ministry official and trade specialist who is now a senior fellow at the influential Center for China and Globalization in Beijing.

But the Chinese government is likely to be dismayed if the United States is reconsidering it as part of any revival of the Obama administration’s geopolitical pivot to Asia, or as part of any attempt to isolate China, Mr. He cautioned.

“That’s what we should be careful about,” he said.

Some current members of the pact greeted Mr. Trump’s comments on Thursday warmly. A spokeswoman for Singapore’s Ministry of Trade and Industry said it welcomed the American interest. “The TPP was designed to be an inclusive agreement, which is open to like-minded countries willing and able to meet its high standards,” the spokeswoman said.

Still, even American allies suggest a long road ahead if Mr. Trump moves forward.

“If the United States genuinely did wish to re-enter, that would trigger another process of engagement and negotiation,” Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand, said on television, adding that she still planned to go forward with the deal as-is. “It’s not just a matter of slotting into an existing deal.”"
"Never Solved, a College Dorm Fire Has Become One Man’s Obsession","In 1966, Mr. Heumann, the technical writer, accompanied him to his family’s Brooklyn home for Thanksgiving. He recalls odd exchanges. His father, a garment worker, mentioned how disappointed he was with his son. At his age, he said, he was running all over New York having a grand time. Sadly, his son wasn’t adventuresome.

Two months before the Res Club fire, the man and some classmates painted a house for a family who had been burned out in a pre-dawn fire.

What else is known?

In a police document harvested by Mr. Fogle, David Katz, a first-year Phud, told an investigator that he had seen the man playing with matches and saw matches and caps for a toy pistol in his suitcase. He also told the police that the man lied about being at home on Eddy Street (the location of the third fire) the night of the Watermargin fire, because he looked for him and couldn’t find him. He discovered the shower running in an empty bathroom. In the police file is a letter the man’s mother wrote to Cornell saying that her son was under immense pressure and having difficulties and needed a break.

Mr. Showalter told me that he reported to the police that he and other Phuds suspected him of setting the minor fires that preceded the fatal fire, since they had seen him fooling with matches. “I mentioned that to him and he said emphatically, at the top of his lungs, ‘That’s a terrible thing to say about anybody,’” Mr. Showalter said. After Watermargin, according to police records, the man declined to take a lie-detector test or talk to the police without a lawyer.

And the new identity. The man told the State Police in 2015 that he changed his name because of friction with his parents and wanted to disconnect from them and not be found. The officer, according to a fellow investigator, didn’t believe him. It would have been unusual to do so at age 19. And the man had visited his family since then.

Arguably suspicious. Also circumstantial. Evidence that a decent defense lawyer would shred.

He came out onto the porch. He was wiry with a speckled beard. When I said I wanted to discuss the Cornell fire, he said, “I prefer not to talk about it.”

Everything else I said drew the same response. It was all he was going to give.

His wife made small talk. He added nothing. Wordlessly, he turned and stepped back inside the house."
Trump Pardons Scooter Libby for Perjury in C.I.A. Leak Case,"After word of Mr. Trump’s plan to issue the pardon emerged on Thursday night, critics of the president quickly interpreted the move as a signal by the president that he would protect those who refuse to turn on their bosses, as Mr. Libby was presumed not to have betrayed Mr. Cheney. Mr. Trump has not ruled out pardons in the Russia investigation.

Mr. Trump had shown no particular interest in Mr. Libby’s case before. In 2015, during his campaign for the White House, Mr. Trump was asked if he would pardon Mr. Libby and declined to say, calling it an irrelevant issue. It was unclear when Mr. Trump would issue the pardon, which was first reported by ABC News.

Mr. Libby was not charged with the leak itself and has long argued that his conviction rested on an innocent difference in memories between him and several witnesses, not an intent to deceive investigators. Although Mr. Bush’s clemency order kept him from going to prison, Mr. Libby’s conviction nonetheless remained intact and he was disbarred as a lawyer as a result. He was not reinstated to the bar until 2016.

Among the allies from the Bush administration who have argued that he was treated unfairly is John R. Bolton, an ally of Mr. Cheney’s who served as Mr. Bush’s ambassador to the United Nations and started this week as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser. Other allies of Mr. Libby’s include Joseph diGenova and Victoria Toensing, a husband-and-wife team of lawyers who recently talked about going to work for Mr. Trump before deciding against it because of a client conflict.

The pardon amounts to official forgiveness, not exoneration. A pardon does not signify innocence but does eliminate many consequences of a conviction, such as any effect on the right to vote, hold elective office or sit on a jury. As a practical matter, those seeking pardons hope it will erase or ease the stigma of a criminal conviction.

Mr. Libby’s prosecution became a symbol of the polarizing politics of the Iraq war during the Bush administration. Ms. Wilson’s husband, Joseph C. Wilson IV, was a former diplomat who wrote an op-ed article in The New York Times in 2003 implying that Mr. Cheney ignored evidence that argued against the conclusion that Iraq was actively seeking to build nuclear weapons.

To undercut Mr. Wilson’s criticism, administration officials told reporters that he had been sent on a fact-finding mission to Niger because his wife worked for the C.I.A., not at the behest of Mr. Cheney. But federal law bars the disclosure of the identities of C.I.A. officials in certain circumstances and the leak prompted a special prosecutor investigation.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Charged with lying to investigators about his interactions with journalists, Mr. Libby insisted he simply remembered events differently. But his version of events clashed with the testimony of eight other people, including fellow administration officials, and a jury convicted him. Mr. Bush decided that the prison sentence was “excessive,” but he said he would not substitute his judgment for that of the jury when it came to the question of Mr. Libby’s guilt.

Mr. Libby’s advocates argued that Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the special prosecutor, went too far because he had already discovered that the first administration official to disclose Ms. Wilson’s identity to a journalist was Richard Armitage, the deputy secretary of state in Mr. Bush’s first term, who was not charged. They also argued that Ms. Wilson was not undercover at the time and her employment was well known. Ms. Wilson has denied that she recommended her husband for the mission to Niger and said her career as a C.I.A. official was “over in an instant” once her identity was leaked.

The case tested the limits of journalistic independence. Judith Miller, then a reporter for The Times, went to prison for 85 days rather than disclose that Mr. Libby had discussed Ms. Wilson with her. She was freed after Mr. Libby released her from any promise of confidentiality.

The issue became a major point of contention between Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney in the last days of the administration in late 2008 and early 2009. Mr. Cheney repeatedly pressed Mr. Bush to go beyond his commutation and issue a full pardon, bringing it up so often that the president grew irritated by the matter.

Mr. Bush assigned White House lawyers to examine the case, but they advised him the jury had ample reason to convict Mr. Libby and the president rebuffed Mr. Cheney’s request. Mr. Bush told aides that he suspected that Mr. Libby had thought he was protecting Mr. Cheney, the real target of the investigation.

Mr. Cheney snapped at Mr. Bush. “You are leaving a good man wounded on the field of battle,” he told him when informed of the decision.

Mr. Bush was taken aback. It was probably the harshest thing Mr. Cheney ever said to him during their eight years in office together and was meant to attack Mr. Bush’s sense of loyalty to his own troops in a time of war.

“The comment stung,” Mr. Bush wrote in his memoir. “In eight years, I had never seen Dick like this, or even close to it. I worried that the friendship we had built was about to be severely strained, at best.”

The case has its connections to Mr. Trump because Mr. Fitzgerald was friends with James B. Comey, who was then the deputy attorney general who assigned him the investigation after the attorney general recused himself. Mr. Cheney long suspected that Mr. Comey was taking revenge for a dispute between them over the legality of a surveillance program.

Mr. Comey would go on to become the director of the F.B.I. who was fired by Mr. Trump last year in the midst of the Russia investigation. His dismissal led the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, who was in charge after the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, to appoint Robert S. Mueller III as special counsel to take over the inquiry.

Mr. Trump has been notably conservative about using his clemency power. Before Friday, he had issued only two pardons and commuted only one sentence in nearly 15 months in office, according to the Justice Department. Most notably he pardoned Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff whose crackdown on illegal immigrants earned him a criminal contempt conviction.

His record is roughly in keeping with the last three presidents, Barack Obama, Mr. Bush and Bill Clinton, all of whom issued no pardons or commutations in their first year and a half in office."
"300 Meters in Gaza: Snipers, Burning Tires and a Contested Fence","A fence that divides Israel and Gaza has become the latest flashpoint in the decades-old conflict, with Israeli soldiers unleashing lethal force against mostly unarmed Arab protesters who have been demonstrating every Friday for the past several weeks.

The image above shows how each side is arrayed in Khan Younis, one of five demonstration sites where 34 Palestinians have been killed since the protests began nearly three weeks ago.

The protests resumed on Friday, and the Palestinians plan to keep the weekly protests going with large turnouts until May 15, when many plan to try to cross the fence en masse. The Gazans are protesting Israel’s blockade, which has been choking off the impoverished coastal strip for more than 10 years. They also want to reassert the rights of refugees and their descendants to reclaim their ancestral lands in Israel, 70 years after hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were displaced.

In Israel’s view, there is nothing benign about the Palestinian claim of a right of return. It would amount to the destruction of Israel by demographic means. And they see the protests as providing cover for violent attacks.

The Fence

The fence that separates Gaza’s 2 million people from Israel is not the sturdiest of barriers. To penetrate Israel, a Gazan would have to get past a crude barbed-wire barrier and cross a short distance, then get over or through a 10-foot-high “smart fence” packed with sensors to detect infiltrators. If a crowd of thousands surged toward the fence, it would take about 30 seconds to cross, the contractor who built it told Bloomberg News.

“We don’t want to be in a position where we have to handle hundreds or thousands of people inside Israel,” Giora Eiland, a retired major general and former head of Israel’s National Security Council, said recently. “This is something we would not be able to contain. So the right way is to make sure nothing happens to the fence.”

That means stopping people from touching it, even with deadly force. Though the protests were initially billed as nonviolent, the Israelis say they have repeatedly discovered grenades and other explosives along the fence, and that Palestinians have sometimes thrown firebombs at their soldiers, not just rocks. Israeli forces have responded lethally.

Few Israelis believe Hamas, the militant Islamic group that rules Gaza and is running the protests, is capable of peaceful protest.

The closer to the fence protesters move, the more perilous it becomes for them. The Israelis have made clear that people they believe are “instigators” are fair game to be targeted. Videos have surfaced of people being shot with their backs turned to the fence, while praying, or with nothing in their hands.

The latest rules of engagement, according to one Israeli report, permit soldiers to shoot armed Palestinians within 300 yards of the fence, and unarmed people within 100 yards of it. The Israelis’ use of live ammunition has prompted demands for an investigation into possible war crimes.

Israeli snipers have positioned themselves atop large sand berms that military engineers are continually reconfiguring with tanks positioned nearby. After protesters burned tires to obscure the soldiers’ view and rolled them toward the fence, the Israelis brought in giant industrial fans to disperse the thick black smoke and powerful water cannons to douse the fires. Soldiers have fired countless volleys of tear gas to try to push back crowds of demonstrators.

The military insists that its soldiers are instructed to shoot to warn, then shoot to wound, before shooting to kill. But the defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, said: “Anyone who approaches the fence endangers his life.”

The Conflict Zone

Some of the protesters sit, while others dart around, taunting Israeli sharpshooters. And some risk their lives by trying to get up to the fence.

Among the Palestinians, approaching the fence makes a powerful statement of defiance, bravery and national pride. A Palestinian photographer has even begun giving wounded protesters framed photos taken of them shortly before they were shot. And the Hamas political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, said in a speech this week that the demonstrators had “taught the world how to be men.”

The Palestinians have much to be angry about. A collapsing economy and a worsening public health crisis along with the 11-year blockade of the tiny, jam-packed territory makes it almost impossible to leave. But the effort is billed as the Great Return March for a reason: Most Gazans are Palestinian refugees or their descendants, and marching on the fence highlights their desire to reclaim the lands and homes from which they were displaced 70 years ago in the war surrounding Israel’s creation.

The Field Hospital

When a demonstrator is shot, others rush to him and quickly carry him off the field to waiting ambulances or to tents that triage and give first aid to the injured. Farthest from the fence, along a road leading to central Khan Younis, is a field hospital with doctors and enough equipment to perform procedures short of major surgery. Other medical tents are staffed mainly by volunteer nursing-school graduates.

As of Friday, 34 people had been killed, three of them under 18 years old, and more than 3,000 had been injured in the demonstrations, according to Gaza health officials. More than 1,000 have been hit by live fire; nearly 1,000 have suffered from gas inhalation; 300 from being hit by rubber bullets and eight people lost fingers or feet.

Families and Prayer

Entire tent villages have been set up to meet the basic needs of demonstrators, and then some. Vendors sell falafel, nuts, sweets and lemonade from ramshackle huts. Once a day or so, a delivery arrives with free slices of pizza or cakes. Large dedicated prayer areas accommodate the faithful. Gaza journalists and radio hosts occupy other tents.

The tents nearest the fence, still not safe from Israeli snipers, house young men, some of them just groups of friends, others organized for various task such as providing tires to burn.

Farther back, many Gaza clans have pitched more elaborate tents with blankets and gas stoves inside, creating the feeling of an offbeat family reunion across much of the protest grounds. At the entrance to one tent, women baked saj, a round bread, over a wood fire on Thursday to hand out to demonstrators. Another tent, with coffee and comfortable sofas inside, was reserved for religious officials.

The organizers have created a festival-like atmosphere, with a robust schedule of daily events: Volleyball and soccer games played by amputees, poetry readings, musical performances, even horse races. The sudden crackle of gunfire and wail of sirens are at times the only giveaways to what is happening a short distance beyond the tents to the east.

The Israeli Side

Avocados, carrots and an abundance of other crops grow along the Gaza border on the Israeli side. Hundreds of Israeli citizens live within a mortar shell’s range of Gaza territory in small communities of farmers such as Nir Oz and Kisufim. The army says its fierce defense of the fence is protecting those citizens — and stopping infiltrators from kidnapping a soldier or two — a longstanding Hamas tactic.

In the Israeli community of Nahal Oz near Gaza on April 6, a group of young people climbed an old watchtower along the community’s western edge, looking out on the disturbances as if they were sitting in the nosebleed seats at a baseball game."
"More Violence, but Just One Killed at Gaza-Israel Fence in 3rd Protest Week","GAZA CITY — Thousands of Palestinians made their way to the fence separating Gaza from Israel again on Friday, and Israeli soldiers again repulsed repeated attempts to cross or damage the barrier with tear gas and live fire, wounding hundreds. But by nightfall only one man was reported killed in the demonstrations, which had claimed dozens of lives on the two previous Fridays.

Nearly 1,000 protesters were wounded, including 223 from gunshots, the Gaza Health Ministry said. Tear gas sufferers included 10 nurses and paramedics in the southern city of Khan Younis. Islam Herzallah, 28, of Gaza City, was shot in the abdomen and killed, bringing the overall death toll to 35.

At the Shejaiya protest site east of Gaza City, where Mr. Herzallah was shot, demonstrators again used thick smoke from burning tires as cover, successfully dismantling an Israeli barrier of coiled barbed wire before retreating when Israeli soldiers shot at them.

Men and even some women, covered head to toe except for their faces, hurled rocks at the Israeli side."

In order to complete the nearly 2,000-mile journey, the Pony Express used 75 horses for every 10 to 15 miles and a fresh rider every 75 to 100 miles to traverse terrain as varied as the Midwestern plains and the Sierra Nevada. The service aimed to connect San Francisco, an isolated town of about 57,000 at the time, to the rest of the country.

The first mail pouch arrived in San Francisco just past midnight on April 14, 1860, to great fanfare. And a delivery from the city to St. Joseph arrived the day before: “The city was illuminated, the citizens paraded the streets with bands of music, fireworks were set off, speeches were made to appropriate the occasion, and the best feeling was manifested by everybody,” read a New York Times report from Missouri.

Tip of the Week

This week I invited Kara Cutruzzula, who writes a fantastic daily newsletter about work, productivity and life in general, to talk about one of her favorite (and mine) productivity hacks: email batching.

What’s the most efficient way to fill a water glass? Turning the tap one centimeter and letting a slow drip top you off? Of course not. You crank that faucet and let the water flow.

That’s what batching emails feels like. Instead of responding one at a time to the forever trickle of your inbox, email batching — responding to as many as possible during a specific timeframe — is incredibly satisfying.

One of my resolutions this year was to spend less of my life in Gmail. Solution? Now I answer emails twice a day, around noon and again at 6 p.m. Knowing I have to get through dozens of important messages makes my replies quicker and crisper; I can also delete the ultimate enemy (junk mail) all at once. Plus, there’s a sense of accomplishment in setting discrete boundaries on an infinite task. Batching emails is like finding the end of pi.

Of course, this idea doesn’t hold water if your job demands immediate responses, but it’s still possible to jump on messages that are urgent, and to corral less important messages for later in the day. Give it a shot!

8 New Books We Recommend This Week,"Photo

Because we work in newspapers, and are as susceptible to buzzy jargon as the next person, we sometimes refer to “the mix” when we try to explain how we make our assignments or schedule our reviews each week. It’s an amorphous term, redolent of Chex cereal or disco floors or cocktail bars, and not easy to define in the context of books journalism. But this week’s recommended titles offer a perfect illustration of the concept: On the surface, these eight books have little in common, but taken together they add up to a broad snapshot of life today. One novel looks at gun culture; another explores how feminism has changed over the years. There’s the memoir of a woman raised among survivalists, and a look at the Syrian civil war, and a deep investigative dive into the 2016 presidential election and possible Russian interference. Less topical, but still fascinating, is Yunte Huang’s thorough history of the 19th-century conjoined twins Chang and Eng. Finally, because sometimes all you want is an original mind or a great escapist plot, we’ve also found a surreal story collection and a retro thriller and introduced them into the — well, you know.

INSEPARABLE: The Original Siamese Twins and Their Rendezvous With American History, by Yunte Huang. (Liveright, $28.95.) Yunte Huang’s new book recounts the extraordinary 19th-century lives of Chang and Eng Bunker, the original “Siamese twins.” The brothers went from the humiliations of showcased servitude all across America to a life of Southern comfort in small-town North Carolina, fathering at least 21 children between them and at one point owning as many as 32 slaves. Our critic Jennifer Szalai calls “Inseparable” a “contemplative yet engrossing” history.

THE FEMALE PERSUASION, by Meg Wolitzer. (Riverhead, $28.) Of all the political threads that permeate Wolitzer’s 12th novel, the most interesting is the challenge of intergenerational feminism. The book “is speaking to the larger issue of ambition: who has it, what curtails it and what it means to reframe it,” Lena Dunham writes in the Book Review. “But when all is said and done, Wolitzer is an infinitely capable creator of human identities that are as real as the type on this page, and her love of her characters shines more brightly than any agenda.”

AETHERIAL WORLDS: Stories, by Tatyana Tolstaya. Translated by Anya Migdal. (Knopf, $25.95.) Tolstaya’s remarkable short stories are all about people haunted by their flashing glimpses of shadow worlds — moments of pure transcendence when the dull plastic coating of reality peels back to reveal something vastly more precious underneath. “Tolstaya is doubly haunted by the past, both by its lostness and by its stubborn refusal to go away,” Lev Grossman writes in his review. “She is blessed, and cursed, with the mystic’s gift of seeing the shades of the departed.”

RUSSIAN ROULETTE: The Inside Story of Putin’s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump, by Michael Isikoff and David Corn. (Twelve, $30.) Two veterans of Washington political journalism provide a thorough and riveting account of the 2016 election that casts an unfavorable light on both the Democratic and Republican campaigns. This is a book without heroes. Reviewing it, Steven Lee Myers of The Times calls the book “a granular, source-on-the-wall election diary” that is “sure to infuriate readers on both sides of what should be the most urgent question facing the nation today: the vulnerability of our democratic institutions to Russian manipulation.”

GUN LOVE, by Jennifer Clement. (Hogarth, $25.) Clement’s novel, her second about the gun trade, unfolds at a Florida trailer park where firearms and people intimately coexist. The imagery is dreamlike, as if to suggest the self-delusion of the novel’s real-life counterparts, Terese Svoboda writes in her review. “But the writing is crisp and the images sharp: a field of 63 Barbies buried up to their knees around a trailer; the hatching of conjoined twin alligators ‘still with white pieces of eggshell on the green, scaly back they shared.’”"
"Homeless in Seattle, and Marrying Under the Overpass","Ms. Vestal, who had dreams of being a veterinarian, was introduced to “life outside” her sheltered upbringing when she was 18. “I went buck wild and told my parents, ‘You can’t tell me what to do no more.’” It was at this point that she met a man who introduced her to crack cocaine. A 30-year addiction to the drug began.

In 1985, Ms. Vestal moved to Seattle, where she has lived, and been mainly homeless, since. She has been married five times previously and has eight grown children: one in Seattle; the others, including two sets of twins, are in Anchorage. “They are all being taken care of,” she said. Aware of the judgments that might be made about some of her life choices, she added, “This doesn’t make me a bad person, because I’m not.”

Mr. Kitcheon (who said he has never used hard drugs; “I just smoke weed and drink beer”) was married once before. His first wife died 25 years ago. After her death, he couldn’t bear to stay in the home where they had raised their 10 children. He put up a tent in the backyard, and much to the confusion of his children, slept outdoors. Mr. Kitcheon said he still owns the five-bedroom Phoenix property where his daughters now live.

“I’m really not homeless,” said Mr. Kitcheon, a Los Angeles native. “I could leave this city any time. I just don’t worry about anything.” He misses his “babies” but has led a transient life for years. “I tell my kids all the time, ‘Pops got to go,’” he said. “But I raised them well.” He said he has four sons: two in the Army, one in the Marines, one in the Navy; and six daughters, all nurses.

The morning of their wedding marked 84 days clean from crack cocaine for Ms. Vestal. It’s the first time that she has tried to stop using the drug. “I would never have done it if it wasn’t for him,” she said, referring to Mr. Kitcheon. “It was really hard, and it’s really hard right now, but knowing that I’m loved and that I’ve got somebody with me, has made it possible.”

Mr. Kitcheon said, “I asked her, ‘Do you want that dope or do you want me?’” He promised that if she was willing to try to quit, he’d help her through it. “I believed in her and she believed in me.”"
Pruitt’s New Deputy: A Coal Lobbyist Steeped in Washington’s Ways,"WASHINGTON — The Senate on Thursday confirmed the Environmental Protection Agency’s second-in-command, Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist who not only shares the deregulatory zeal of Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A. chief, but also his doubtful view of climate science.

More notable, however, are the differences between the two men.

Unlike Mr. Pruitt, a Washington outsider caught in a swirl of controversy over his costly first-class travel and security spending, Mr. Wheeler is viewed as a low-key insider with years of Washington experience in the art of pursuing policy change while avoiding public distraction.

Deregulation is among President Trump’s central campaign promises, and Mr. Pruitt has proposed ambitious rollbacks of rules governing clean air and water and fighting against climate change. But many of his initiatives have stumbled because of haste or imprecision, and at least six have been struck down by the courts. That makes the arrival of Mr. Wheeler’s expertise particularly consequential.

In fact, on Thursday Mr. Trump also sent new marching orders to the E.P.A., directing the agency to weaken or delay implementation of a variety of air pollution regulations, several of which have been priorities for industries for which Mr. Wheeler has lobbied in the past."
Car Stolen in Alaska? It Could Be Your Neighbor Chasing the Thief,"By now, the dispatchers and officers — even the chief of police — know him simply as Floyd. By his own tally, he has found and helped return about 75 vehicles so far this year. The authorities in Anchorage say they have not tracked the number of people, like Floyd, who have taken on roles as self-appointed spotters, watchers, trackers or all-around crime fighters, but that they are numerous. Frustration has fueled their energy, and social media has given them tools to coordinate efforts.

Alaska often zigs while the rest of the nation zags; its economy boomed through the nation’s recession a decade ago. Now property crimes have spiked in the Anchorage area, where a majority of Alaskans live, even as such offenses have been declining for the nation as a whole, federal figures show.

That is making way for people like John Staser, another civilian crime fighter in Anchorage. Mr. Staser, 60, is a fit-looking retired lieutenant colonel in the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the co-owner of two sporting goods stores that have been hit lately by increased shoplifting.

Photo

Not long ago, when Mr. Staser suspected someone had been stealing, he held the culprit with a Taser at a store’s front door until the police arrived. He said he once followed another man on foot for about 45 minutes, trying to talk to him about issues of “accountability for his actions,” even though the stolen goods, valued at about $1,500, had been dropped at the store’s door. Mr. Staser only ended his pursuit after the man desperately waved a $20 bill at a passing motorist, climbed into the car and raced off.

Mr. Staser said he knows that he might one day cross a line and put himself at risk. The culprits are almost all much younger than he is, for one thing.

“I’ve got to stop chasing these guys,” he said, shaking his head.

Anchorage, a city with nearly 300,000 residents, has long had its share of rough edges, including patterns of homelessness and transience, with people here for a while, then gone. In interviews around the city, people said they still felt safe walking around, day or night, but the need to lock doors — a new imperative here — has left them unsettled.

Anchorage set a record for homicides last year, with 35, though violent crimes overall were up only slightly, according to the F.B.I. Some other American cities have far higher per capita rates of killings, but Alaskans say the uptick in property crime is still palpable.

The Anchorage Police Department says auto thefts jumped by 52 percent in 2017 over the previous year. In the first two months of 2018, the numbers were up again — 27 percent over the same period last year. The city went from having the nation’s 47th highest rate of auto theft per capita in 2015 to the sixth highest in 2016, according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau, an insurance industry-funded group.

Some people here attribute the rising crime to an increase in opioid addiction and an economic downturn. The state’s unemployment rate, 7.3 percent in February, was the highest in the nation, as the state’s oil industry has sputtered. The State Legislature also overhauled the criminal justice system in 2016, reducing penalties for some property crimes.

“There isn’t just one thing,” Justin Doll, the Anchorage police chief, said. Chief Doll said that new hires have brought the department to its highest staffing ever, with 435 officers, giving him hope that the crime trend can change. Arrests for car theft have also increased, he said, adding: “To me that suggests we’re starting to have an impact.”

But car theft in Alaska is unique. Thieves swiping a car in the lower 48 have options: Drive it to another state for resale or sell the parts for scrap. There are few getaways here. A 20-hour drive to the capital, Juneau, still leaves you inside state borders. And most communities — more than 85 percent — aren’t reachable by road at all.

So vehicles are stolen to commit other crimes, the police said, or to live in for a while, or simply as a quick lift. It also means that most stolen cars are eventually recovered and returned — if worse for wear.

“I’ve seen cars stolen, abandoned, then stolen again by somebody else,” Mr. Hall, the stolen car chaser, said.

Car thefts have surged in winter, when people start their cars and leave them warming, keys in plain view. That prompted Tracy Lohman and her husband, Tom, to buy a car with a remote that starts their vehicle from inside the house.

Karen Stephens, an architect, said everybody knows somebody who has been a victim.

“I used to leave my house, my car, everything, open all the time — all the time,” she said.

Some residents said they believed that an assumption that most Alaskans are armed — an idea borne out by studies — may be keeping crime from getting worse.

“Everyone’s got a gun inside their house, you know, so not too many people are concerned about home invasion,” said Blake Quackenbush, a lawyer.

Chief Doll said he supports citizen activism like neighborhood watches, but said he worries that more aggressive tactics could drift toward vigilante justice.

“Nobody is doing this with anything other than good intentions in trying to help keep the community safe, but it’s really dangerous,” Chief Doll said.

“What I would encourage Floyd or anybody to do is to continue to be active, be a voice for public safety,” he said. “But when crime actually happens, let us deal with it.”"
"L.A. Times’s New Owner Plans Big Moves. First Up, Relocating to the Suburbs.","Negotiations over the purchase of the paper, which some people familiar with the deal had expected to be completed by the end of March, have dragged. Part of the issue is that the deal was put together quickly — in just a matter of days — and due diligence is taking longer than expected. Tronc’s technology had also been supporting The Times, and the two sides are trying to reach an agreement to keep the paper running until it can build its own capabilities, according to one of the people.

On a recent afternoon, Dr. Soon-Shiong, dressed in a dark suit and light blue Ferragamo tie, laid out an ambitious vision for The Times that involves leveraging technology, extending the paper’s video and podcast abilities and moving its headquarters to a new campus. At turns jocular and loquacious, he discussed hiring a top editor and stressed the importance of editorial independence and tolerance. Among the prominent editors he has pursued are two Los Angeles Times veterans — Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The New York Times, and Marty Baron, the executive editor of The Washington Post.

“I look upon the newspaper — on the newsroom side of it and the editorial chief side of it — to be completely independent, factual, honest, fair,” he said. “It also needs to be inspiring, compassionate and caring.”

Journalists in the newsroom, which is exhausted by years of tumult under previous ownership, are cautiously optimistic that Dr. Soon-Shiong will reinvent the paper and return it to financial strength, just as another billionaire, Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, has done at The Washington Post.

The city’s political and cultural elites see Dr. Soon-Shiong as the last, best hope to restore the paper’s place as an important civic institution in a sprawling region that lacks a true center of gravity, with a mayor whose powers are smaller than in other big cities, and where economic power is diffuse, spreading across industries like Hollywood and tech.

“I see it as a mechanism of binding the community,” Dr. Soon-Shiong said. “And sort of a grounding force.”

For now, at least, Dr. Soon-Shiong’s purchase has achieved one goal long held by civic leaders — and Times journalists: Return the paper to local hands.

Since the Chandler family sold The Times Mirror Company to the Chicago-based Tribune Company in 2000, The Times has operated under corporate control, weathering cost cuts, severe layoffs and, for a time, a frat house culture that spilled from the top ranks.

Despite the renewed buoyancy in the Times newsroom, it is not clear whether Dr. Soon-Shiong, who moved to Los Angeles in 1980 and built a fortune in health care, can reinvigorate a once-storied news organization whose newsroom is so hard-pressed for resources.

He has no experience running a newspaper, though he had been a major shareholder in The Times’s parent company, Tronc. While he has amassed a fortune from a successful cancer drug, Abraxane, and built an array of health care companies that deal with artificial intelligence high-speed computer networks, he has been dogged by detractors. Scientists have met with skepticism his stated ambition to cure cancer by stimulating a patient’s immune system. And he has been accused of steering philanthropic donations to entities that do business with his companies.

“I’m ambitious,” he said. “I want to cure cancer, I want to find a universal flu vaccine, I want to find the cause of Alzheimer’s, I want to figure out how to regenerate your tissue. That is an ambitious program.”

“I think if you are trying to do a cutting edge, complex, ambitious project, that may be perceived as overpromising,” he added.

Photo

His plans for The Times are certainly grand, if undefined.

In the weeks since the deal was announced in February, Dr. Soon-Shiong has been on something of a listening tour, calling on former staff members and seeking out advice from luminaries in journalism. He has spoken, for instance, to Mr. Baquet of The New York Times and Mr. Baron of The Washington Post, as well as Donald Graham, the former publisher of The Post, and Norman Pearlstine, a former top editor at The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and Time Inc.

In private conversations, Dr. Soon-Shiong has mused about trying to lure a big name editor to lead The Times.

“He’s swinging for the fences, and I think that’s a good strategy,” said Matt Toledo, the former publisher of the Los Angeles Business Journal and a friend of Dr. Soon-Shiong’s.

Though he had not yet addressed the Times newsroom before Friday, he had met with the paper’s top editors, telling them he planned to invest in the paper, make Washington reporting a priority and expand the paper’s foreign coverage, according to two people familiar with the meeting.

He also told them he had decided to buy the paper after hearing Tronc planned to close its Washington bureau so it could afford an expensive new lease for The Times’s headquarters.

In the interview, Dr. Soon-Shiong expressed interest in expanding Times journalism beyond the written word and said he would build a state-of-the-art studio for video and podcasts. He has been particularly enamored with “Dirty John,” a true-crime podcast produced by the Times reporter Christopher Goffard, and attended a Lakers game recently with Mr. Goffard.

Though much of his plans are still unclear, he spoke excitedly about goals for his newspaper’s new space.

He wants lots of light, a day care center, a museum to honor the newspaper’s history and modern technology. Eventually, he said, he would like to build a basketball court — he has one below his Brentwood mansion, as well — and open the campus up to the public to allow readers to see how the newspaper is put together.

And while he is still grappling with whether The Times should be a local or regional newspaper versus a national or global news outlet, he said he thought the country needed a major news organization on the West Coast to countervail the powerful institutions, like The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and The Post — on the East Coast.

“I think we will make each other’s boats rise and save this whole industry,” he said.

Several people who have spoken to Dr. Soon-Shiong about the newspaper characterized him as smart, tech savvy and eager to learn about a business in which he has until now largely admired from afar. But many of his inquiries have revealed his inexperience in running a newspaper: He has, for instance, asked how journalists put together coverage and whether the same newsroom staff can work on print and digital.

Dr. Soon-Shiong’s wife, Michele Chan, a former actress, has accompanied him to some of the meetings about The Times, and also seemed to be involved in decision-making, Mr. Pearlstine said. “She talks really eloquently about wanting the workplace to be more diverse and more reflective of the community it covers,” he said.

Mr. Pearlstine said that in their discussions about the newspaper, Dr. Soon-Shiong “talked a lot about this desire for a legacy.”

Not exactly an unknown in Los Angeles, Dr. Soon-Shiong remains a largely obscure figure in a city that values celebrity and personal achievement. His philanthropy has been mainly focused on health care — his name adorns a hospital in Santa Monica. And he prefers to pal around with ballplayers (he owns a piece of the Lakers) rather than Hollywood types. He is, though, close to Mark Burnett, the reality television producer behind “The Apprentice,” who sits on the board of one of his biotech companies, NantHealth.

Dr. Soon-Shiong said that his focus will remain on his day job — trying to cure cancer. But he has suggested to others that he may appoint himself as publisher of The Times. He dismissed that out of hand in the interview, saying, “I see myself as an owner who can approach the challenges facing the industry with a fresh set of eyes.”

Still, there are questions of whether or not he will seek to influence the positions of the editorial page. The Los Angeles Times, once a conservative paper, is now a liberal voice in a city and state that is solidly progressive. Much like the state and city it covers, the editorial pages have been a voice of opposition in the Trump era.

Dr. Soon-Shiong describes himself as an independent, and he has supported both Republicans and Democrats. He said he has a fondness for Rudy Giuliani, a Republican and the former New York mayor, whom he met when Mr. Giuliani was treated for cancer.

During the transition after the 2016 election, Dr. Soon-Shiong met with Donald J. Trump and discussed a job overseeing health care. A job offer never materialized, according to a person apprised of the talks, because of the controversies over Mr. Soon-Shiong’s charitable giving, which were laid out in Politico last April.

When asked about the paper’s position on President Trump, and if he would impose his own views on the editorial board, Dr. Soon-Shiong said, “I need to set the tone of compassion and caring. I don’t want a vindictive paper.”

Of Mr. Trump, he said: “I think my best response is he’s our president. I’m here to say that what we need to do is ensure that we can do everything we can for the president to succeed because I think it’s good for our nation.”"
"This 1,000-Year-Old Shirt Has a $700,000 Story to Tell","Why would a shirt be worth so much money? Find out.

Ashkan Baghestani and Benedict Carter of Sotheby’s with the 7th–9th century shirt. Lauren Fleishman for The New York Times

Why would a shirt be worth 500,000 pounds (about $701,720)? First, because it is 1,000 years old. Second, because it is from a lost empire. And third, because it is proof of the way clothes have been used to express power and aspiration for millenniums. Or so believes Sotheby’s, which is auctioning the one-of-a-kind golden silk samite shirt on April 25 in London.

“A piece like this and in this kind of condition is indescribably rare,” said Benedict Carter, the head of auction sales for the Middle East department of Sotheby’s.

The shirt is decorated with ducks wearing scarves and holding pearl necklaces in their beaks, encased in octagon motifs featuring hearts, among other shapes. These patterns reveal the shirt’s provenance: It was likely owned by a roving dignitary or courtier of the Sogdian Empire. Filled with traders who bartered slaves, horses, perfumes and more along the ancient Silk Road, the Sogdian kingdom was centered in modern-day Uzbekistan and Tajikistan more than 1,000 years ago, and died out in the 10th century.

And that is just the beginning of the story written in its seams."
Cambridge Analytica and the Coming Data Bust,"And its users unwittingly took part in a social-data boom and are only now starting to feel the consequences. The ease and speed with which internet users trust tech companies with the data they crave are wildly out of proportion with the risks they’re assuming in doing so, in no small part because, out of negligence or institutional blindness, the companies couldn’t anticipate the risks themselves. After all, Facebook spent years fortifying itself against hackers and spammers only to be rolled by political actors posing as app developers.

This pattern — a boom based on credible-seeming promises that are a little too good to be true, followed years later by a bust confirming that they indeed were — is familiar from a different world: finance. The financial crisis was materially devastating in a way that a privacy crisis couldn’t be; poor stewardship of user data isn’t going to evict people from their homes. But among the lingering and underrated consequences of the collapse of the global financial system was a total loss in trust in the institutions that were supposed to prevent it. The disorienting and thoroughly unsatisfying Cambridge Analytica saga is a preview of what trailing indicators of the collapse of the data boom might look like: revealing signs, evident years later, that something was rotten with these arrangements, arriving too late to be actionable but soon enough to foster resentment against companies and services on which we’ve come to depend.

Photo

Experiences that test our trust of the free-services-for-personal-data internet are accumulating and threaten to become more personal: the failure of Twitter to ban someone who harassed or threatened you; a small but embarrassing email hack resulting in a scammer asking old friends for money and concluding with an admonishment from your provider that you just needed a better password; an identity theft, a suffering credit score and then news of a hack at Equifax, a service to which you never even chose to provide data. Or it could be nothing more than an eerily well-targeted ad, one that suggests that a certain service — maybe one you never even meant to interact with — knows things about you that you don’t remember telling it.

The wider consequences of these arrangements are harder to quantify and sometimes even to see. They are: a social-media ecosystem that has annexed the news and the public sphere; nascent but increasingly assertive systems of identity and social currency that seek to transcend borders while answering only to investors; billions of lives’ worth of trustingly volunteered data in the hands of companies that might want to make money from it, or that might have no need for it anymore, or that might go out of business, change ownership or simply forget what they had in the first place. Perhaps someone — a new partner, an enterprising researcher, a repressive government — might, one day, discover new uses for the data.

A loss of faith in tech companies as semipublic infrastructure would also arrive simultaneously with an understanding that that’s what they had been all along: services that we depended on, ones we gave ourselves to, and that revealed themselves to be — or merely became — the sorts of services we’d rather not. They’re not too big to fail in the banking sense. But they’re similarly hard to budge, having constructed entire modes of interaction, consumption and identity verification that are now intimately interwoven with our lives, so all-encompassing that they’ve practically become invisible. To stop using these products is to leave the internet, and these companies made it their mission to make sure there isn’t anywhere else to go.

In a recent conference call with reporters, Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive, confessed that Facebook ought to do a better job of putting privacy tools in front of users, but in the same breath he encouraged people to use the tools and to “make sure that they’re comfortable with how their information is used on our services and others.” It was a gesture at dusty old user agreements — an emphasis on the fact that we technically consented to this, and that if he was expected to hold up his end of the deal, we should be too. It called to mind a line of the financial industry’s post-crisis defense: Borrowers should have read the fine print. But for the tech industry, this posture is even more of a stretch: It’s an argument for honoring the status quo, coming from the people who have made it their mission to destroy it."
"Flexing Their Support for Cuomo, Key Unions Leave Working Families Party","Mr. Lipton added that the groups in question — Citizen Action, New York Communities for Change and Make the Road Action — had been “at the forefront” of several of the governor’s signature accomplishments, including increasing the minimum wage and criminal justice reform.

The governor, a second-term Democrat facing re-election in the fall, has been aggressive in fending off Ms. Nixon’s unexpectedly vigorous primary challenge, which was announced in mid-March, and has since garnered endorsements from a handful of liberal groups.

The most recent nod came early Friday, when Make the Road Action — a grass-roots immigrant rights group that receives ample funding from labor — said it would back Ms. Nixon because of “her strong progressive platform and her commitment to passing and implementing the full protections and supports that our communities need and deserve.”

The governor’s campaign said that no member of Mr. Cuomo’s administration was at the meeting on Friday, and referred questions to labor groups themselves.

Michael Mulgrew, president of the teachers’ union, said he urged the advocacy groups on Friday to have the W.F.P. remain neutral until after the Democratic primary.

If the group endorses Ms. Nixon and she loses the Democratic primary to Mr. Cuomo, she could remain on the ballot through November competing for votes, potentially to the benefit of the Republican nominee.

“My only concern is some reckless behavior that will have an unintended consequence of us ending up with a Republican governor,” Mr. Mulgrew said. “When these elections are over, we will judge any decision we have to make off your behavior if you caused bad things to happen — even though it was not your intent you are responsible for them.”

He declined to comment on whether Mr. Cuomo had asked him to defund community groups backing Ms. Nixon, saying he has “requests on all sides.”

“I’m not going to divulge personal conversations,” he said.

According to two people in the meeting, the governor’s funding threats went unspoken but still loomed large.

“You have the largest labor unions in the room who also have been our biggest funders arguing Cynthia should not get the W.F.P. line, which is a pretty forceful argument coming from your biggest funders,” said one participant, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting and for fear of angering Mr. Cuomo.

Among the labor leaders in attendance were leaders or representatives from Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, R.W.D.S.U., Communications Workers of America District 1 and the U.F.T., which collectively provide hundreds of thousands of dollars to the community groups.

Héctor Figueroa, president of Local 32BJ, and Dennis Trainor, vice president of C.W.A. District 1, confirmed their unions’ withdrawal from the Working Families Party, saying in a joint statement that they “fundamentally believe that endorsing Governor Cuomo is the most effective way to put the interest of working families first.”

“The latest developments show that the current leadership of the W.F.P. disagrees with that approach, and we have been unable to convince them otherwise,” they said, adding, “We are not attending tomorrow’s state committee meeting and will be pulling out of the New York State Working Families Party.”

The pressure in labor ranks comes even as the W.F.P. is expected to meet in Albany on Saturday to consider endorsing Ms. Nixon, an educational advocate and actress who is making her first run for public office.

On Thursday afternoon, Mr. Cuomo had appeared at a rally with a variety of labor leaders to present himself as their champion, and they as his ardent supporters.

“It is the union family,” Mr. Cuomo said. “When one of us is in trouble, we’re all in trouble. It’s solidarity. We stand together.”"
‘It Has to Be Perfect’: Putting Out a Yearbook After the Parkland Shooting,"Moments after that terrible Valentine’s Day, the thought crept into the minds of the Aerie yearbook staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. They would have to memorialize this tragedy in their pages. Somehow.

At first, some students hesitated. “I thought it’d be too much,” said Elizabeth Stout, 17, a senior who is the book’s co-editor in chief, of the staff’s offer to write about the students killed. “I didn’t know at the time if it’d even be right to.”

Few students who have survived mass shootings in schools have faced the same dilemma. The children at Sandy Hook were too young. Those at Columbine were too far along in the school year.

At Stoneman Douglas High, where a former student is accused of killing 17 people in a deadly rampage, editors decided the shooting would not overtake their book. They insisted on preserving a record of the days that came before, the ones filled with the regular markers of high school life: Football games. Club activities. The Sadie Hawkins dance."
E. Coli Linked to Chopped Romaine Lettuce Infects People in 11 States,"Photo

Nearly three dozen people have been infected in an E. coli outbreak linked to chopped romaine lettuce from the Yuma, Ariz., region, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

The agency said that it had not yet identified a grower, supplier, distributor or brand common to the 35 cases of infection across 11 states, so it urged consumers to avoid any chopped romaine lettuce from the Yuma area.

“If you cannot confirm the source of the lettuce, do not buy or eat it,” the C.D.C. said in a statement. The agency also recommended that restaurants and retailers not serve chopped romaine lettuce from the region.

The people infected so far range in age from 12 to 84 years old. Of the 22 people hospitalized in the outbreak, three had developed a type of kidney failure, according to the C.D.C. No deaths have been reported. Because of an average reporting delay of two to three weeks, illnesses that may have occurred after March 27 have not yet been counted.

The C.D.C. said that 26 of 28 infected individuals surveyed reported eating a salad at a restaurant, with romaine lettuce being the only common ingredient. The restaurants reported using bagged, chopped romaine lettuce.

The agency said it is still working to pinpoint the source of the outbreak.

The infections are somewhat spread out, geographically. Nine people were infected in Pennsylvania, more than any other state. Eight people were infected in Idaho and seven in New Jersey."
Bank Earnings Boom as Regulators Relax Rules,"Photo

Turbulent markets and relaxed regulations are great news for banks — and it shows.

Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, the first big United States banks to report their first-quarter results, reported on Friday that business was booming on their stock trading desks as markets gyrated wildly during the first three months of the year. And they reaped greater profits from their core lending businesses, thanks to rising interest rates.

Their results could represent the beginning of a new period of vigor for the banking industry, which in recent years has had to contend with a mix of ill winds, including an eerie quiet in markets, which depressed their usually lucrative trading businesses.

Improved business conditions are good news for banks, but the prospect of regulators loosening up their oversight could be even better over the long haul.

Citigroup and JPMorgan both revealed slightly thinner capital cushions in the first quarter, apparently reflecting their expectation that regulators would ease rules for banks in the coming months. With reduced capital buffers, the banks can afford to spend more on repurchasing their shares, distributing dividends to shareholders, paying their employees or lending more to clients.

The reduction in the banks’ capital cushions is slight, but it is a sign that actions by the Trump administration and its appointees are having a concrete impact on the banking industry."
Oklahoma Teachers End Walkout After Winning Raises and Additional Funding,"Teachers had initially demanded the repeal of a capital-gains tax exemption, which applies to wealthy individuals. Instead, many of the new taxes will be paid by average Oklahomans.

To fund the measures, as well as some limited new revenues for schools, the Republican-controlled Legislature and Gov. Mary Fallin instituted new or higher taxes on oil and gas production, tobacco, motor fuels, and online sales. The state will also allow ball and dice gambling, which will be taxed.

“The big win happened before the walkout started,” said Brent Bushey, executive director of the Oklahoma Public School Resource Center, which provides administrative services for small school districts. “It is a short-term win, but my focus is how do we turn this into a long-term focus on education.”

Gregg Garn, the dean of the college of education at the University of Oklahoma, said that who won or lost is yet to be determined. “The teachers clearly were able to make some good strides,” he said. “In the long run, if candidates that support education get elected, that’s what will determine who won or lost.”

Some teachers seemed ambivalent about ending the walkout.

“I don’t want to say I agree 100 percent with us stopping this walkout, but I do understand,” said Cory Williams, a teacher at George Washington Carver Middle School in Tulsa, who participated in days of protests at the Capitol. “We are going to get to the point where it is an unstoppable force meets an unmovable object. It is hard to fight against that without changing your tactics.”

The recent wave of teacher protests, which has rocked several conservative states, began this year in West Virginia, where teachers won a $2,000 raise from lawmakers. The outcome of the struggle in Oklahoma was being watched carefully in Kentucky, where some school districts will be closed on Friday as teachers demonstrate in favor of education funding, as well as in Arizona, where a teacher movement calling itself #RedforEd is demanding raises and more money for schools.

In Arizona, Gov. Doug Ducey, under pressure from teachers who have threatened a walkout, announced on Thursday a plan to provide teachers with a raise by 2020, which he said could be accomplished without raising taxes.

In Oklahoma, some rank-and-file educators expressed displeasure on social media that the union was calling off the walkout, and were discussing whether teachers could continue the work stoppage on their own.

Nevertheless, the new taxes in Oklahoma represent a victory for teachers in a state that, over the last decade, has pursued some of the deepest tax and public-service cuts in the nation.

The oil and gas industry, long favored in the state, was among the groups disappointed by the new taxes.

Chad Warmington, president of the Oklahoma Oil & Gas Association, said the industry supported an increase in education funding, but should not have been made to shoulder the burden. He said that because oil and gas prices are volatile, the new production tax was “a raw deal for teachers” and pointed to other areas where taxes could have been raised.

“Oklahoma has eliminated $1 billion in personal income tax,” he said, referring to some estimates of lost state revenue from cuts in recent years. But he added, “I don’t think there’s political will to do a personal income tax hike.”

Allies of the industry may try to introduce a ballot referendum to reverse the increase in production taxes.

As in West Virginia, rank-and-file teachers started the walkout movement by organizing on Facebook, at first without much help from unions. The Oklahoma Education Association gave legislators until late April to provide new revenues or face a walkout, but teachers protested and pushed the union to adopt an April 1 deadline. In Oklahoma, union membership is optional for teachers. Still, the large rallies, marches and lobbying that developed around the walkout would not have been possible without the muscle of state and national labor organizations.

Parents, too, participated in protests. Lanae DeArman of Sulphur, Okla., joined picketing teachers at the Capitol, lobbying her representatives to raise taxes to fund education. She had never been involved in politics before, she said, but the condition of her three children’s schools — aging textbooks, broken furniture — drove her to act.

“It has gone too far,” she said of the state’s tax cuts. “You want to be able to keep what you make, but where’s the line? I myself, personally, would be willing to pay a little more if it meant adequate funding for our schools.”

Ms. DeArman said she planned to vote this year and would be carefully considering candidates’ education platforms.

Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, which represents educators in Oklahoma City, said the movement could shake up national politics. “A lot of people in these states, including some of our teachers, voted for Trump,” she said. Now, she added, unions hope to spread the message that conservative policies lead to the school budget cuts that teachers and parents have been protesting.

“The not-so-sleeper issue in this next election is public education,” Ms. Weingarten said."
Taking a Leaf Out of Thoreau’s Book,"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.

This week, we’ll have a quick E.P.A. update for you, we’ll look at a surprising contribution to climate science from the 19th century, and we’ll bring you up to speed on newly released Shell documents.

The latest on Pruitt and the E.P.A.

In last week’s newsletter we summed up why Scott Pruitt, chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, was under fire. (It’s a lot to absorb: ethics scandals over travel, housing, security and staff moves.) Despite the imbroglio, Mr. Pruitt, who has been on a roll in rolling back Obama-era regulations, ostensibly remains in favor with President Trump. A few updates since last week:

One of Mr. Pruitt’s top advisers, Samantha Dravis, resigned.

An internal E.P.A. assessment, obtained by two senators, said the justifications for extra security spending that were provided by Mr. Pruitt’s security team didn’t hold up.

We also published a story about how several E.P.A. officials who raised concerns about Mr. Pruitt’s spending have been reassigned or demoted, or requested new jobs. And another story about how Mr. Pruitt’s regulatory rollbacks, some of which have been hastily implemented, may not hold up in court.

Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, John F. Kelly, advised him to fire Mr. Pruitt, according to two officials. But Mr. Trump later tweeted: “Scott is doing a great job!”

Climate data that transcends time"
"In Brisbane, Gauge Stands Apart From the Imitators","BRISBANE, Australia — The restaurant’s name will be a single word: stark, vaguely industrial, somewhat meaningless. There will be some sort of sculptural tartare on the menu, and probably a kingfish ceviche. Saltbush and kangaroo and finger lime will all make appearances. The format is a tasting menu or shared plates or a combination of both; the wines are natural. Ben Shewry has a lot to answer for.

Mr. Shewry’s Melbourne restaurant, Attica, has helped transform Australia’s dining landscape, with an emphasis on native ingredients and inventive local winemakers and a penchant for layered, unexpected flavors. It also has spawned a thousand imitators.

Perhaps it would be more generous to say that Attica has inspired a new generation of Australian chefs. (Some of the blame, or credit, should be spread around; the chef Dan Hunter, of Brae, is similarly influential, and René Redzepi’s brief Australian iteration of Noma left an indelible mark.)

Australia now has a style of dining that is immensely recognizable. But it can be very difficult to tell one “modern Australian” restaurant from another. Much like the natural wines that dominate their lists, this crop of restaurants has a lot of potential, and plenty of intrigue and newness. But sometimes exploring the brave new world of natural wine will have you thinking: “I probably like this? I know I’m supposed to like it. But also: this kind of tastes like armpit cider.” Modern Australian dining experiences are often similarly, or simultaneously, problematic.

New Zealand Cites Climate Change in Banning New Offshore Drilling,"The government said it would allow the existing 22 active offshore permits, covering more than 38,000 square miles, to run until their expiration, which is “as far out as 2030.”

Companies that find more oil and gas reserves where they already have permits could drill for decades, and new onshore permits could be issued.

The Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of New Zealand criticized the government for not consulting the industry, saying that alternative energy sources were not yet ready to meet demand and that oil would have to be imported from other countries at a higher cost.

“The decision is a lose-lose for New Zealand’s economy and environment, likely to threaten jobs and mean higher prices for consumers,” said Cameron Madgwick, the association’s chairman.

The mayor of New Plymouth, the largest city in Taranaki, the area where the country’s oil and gas exploration is concentrated, called the decision “a kick in the guts” for the regional economy.

“This announcement sends a message to some of Taranaki’s major investors and employers that they do not have a long-term future in New Zealand,” Mayor Neil Holdom said.

Simon Bridges, the leader of the center-right National Party, New Zealand’s main opposition party, said on Twitter that the decision to end oil and gas exploration was “a wrecking ball” that could only hurt the country.

The government said that “no current jobs” would be lost, as it was “honoring all agreements with current permit holders.”

Government figures show that in New Zealand’s crude oil production declined in 2016 to the lowest level in a decade, and spending on production had fallen in line with a global drop in prices stemming from the shale revolution in the United States.

New Zealand imports more oil than it exports, and it is a small player on the world stage, with industry figures putting the value of exports at $1.1 billion a year.

A page on the New Zealand Trade and Enterprise website — a government agency that promotes international trade and economic development — says the government’s aim is “to increase the value of New Zealand petroleum exports tenfold” by 2025.

In Australia, plans to drill for natural gas offshore in the Great Australian Bight, known as Australia’s Galápagos, have drawn criticism from the fishing and tourism industries, which the potential of a spill is too great a risk."
Threatened: A Green-Haired Turtle That Can Breathe Through Its Genitals,"Photo

In the debate over saving endangered species, it may be that some should get priority just because of how weird they are.

Take the green-haired turtle. It breathes through its genitals. Not all the time — but after a long time underwater, an alternative way to get oxygen really helps.

The turtle is thirtieth on a new list of reptiles in trouble put out by the Zoological Society of London. The Edge of Existence program at the society looks at the evolutionary trees of animals that are endangered to determine which are most evolutionary distinctive.

Previously, they put out lists for mammals and amphibians. The new list ranks reptiles on a combination of how distinctive and how endangered they are.

Rikki Gumbs and other researchers at the society who worked on the new list wrote a paper explaining how they arrive at the rankings, which was published in the journal PLOS One on Wednesday."
What Separates Ordinary Bad News From True ‘Disaster’?,"The explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986 has often been described as the worst nuclear disaster in history. But there are records of several larger and more destructive catastrophes. In “The Age of Radiance,” a history of the nuclear era, Craig Nelson cites a 1957 plutonium-plant accident in the Ural Mountains that irradiated an area 14 times as large as the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. There are other examples, too, but these accidents weren’t publicized, because they took place in the U.S.S.R. during the secretive era before glasnost. So what makes Chernobyl history’s worst? It’s the fact that we all know about it.

In other words, our collective reckoning of what is or isn’t a disaster entails publicity. Disasters are news because they are news.

Trump isn’t the only one who sees disaster everywhere. In every section of the newspaper, one has either just happened, is unfolding now or is about to occur. It’s surprisingly common in the sports section, as in “Sixers avoid another near disaster with comeback” — in sports, success and catastrophic failure can lie just a point or two apart. Most news disasters, though, are more literal, from the almost benign “natural disaster” to the more threatening “climate disaster” to the downright sinister “disaster capitalism.”

In March, FEMA released a new five-year strategic plan, calling for less bureaucracy and more civilian disaster preparedness. It was soon followed by a news release from the Union for Concerned Scientists, reporting that the plan had been scrubbed of references to climate change. Citizens of the United States, according to the FEMA administrator Brock Long, needed to “go back to the old civil defense days of being ready.” This advice would be echoed, two weeks later, in Rick Santorum’s claim that instead of fighting for gun control, students should learn CPR: disaster preparedness as pre-emptive victim-blaming. (Santorum has since said that he “misspoke.”)

If disasters must be sudden, as both of Merriam-Webster’s definitions attest, must they also be surprising and unpredictable? Disasters, like accidents, are often described as “waiting to happen.” The Challenger explosion has become a case study in avoidable disaster; it was known among NASA staff that one component had a high risk of failure under the unusually cold flight conditions that morning. They went ahead with the launch anyway.

It’s possible all disasters are disasters waiting to happen. The word is so common that it’s easy not to see its Latin roots hiding in plain sight: Dis as in negative, aster as in star. Ill starred. The etymology suggests that disasters are destined, inevitable, like a Greek tragedy. Fourteen years before the Titanic sank, the American writer Morgan Robertson published a novella called “The Wreck of the Titan: Or, Futility,” in which the titular ship sinks after striking an iceberg. Twelve years before that, a British journalist named W.T. Stead wrote a short story meant to serve as a warning to the public of inadequate safety measures on ocean liners. He died on the Titanic.

It’s tempting, perhaps, to think of disasters as fated; it lets us off the hook. But the sense that a catastrophe could have been avoided through better planning only heightens our impression of the event as a disaster. Climate disasters, for instance, are now entirely expected, and we’ve known for years that the worst outcomes could be avoided with immediate and drastic action. But we don’t take that action. Our utter failure to respond in kind is part of the disaster.

On March 17, a BBC headline announced plans for a “Norcroft Colliery memorial for ‘unknown’ mining disaster.” David Hinchliffe, a former member of Parliament, was working to fund a memorial for the victims of an 1821 incident outside Barnsley, England, in which 10 workers, five men and five boys, were killed when a chain broke as they tried to ascend a mine shaft. He’s the one who called it “an unknown disaster” — “with unmarked graves, it has been forgotten.”

How could a disaster be unknown? And while certainly tragic, wouldn’t 10 deaths in a 19th-century mine more properly be termed an accident — one that’s not particularly unexpected or urgent? But the youngest victim of the accident, John Hinchliffe, was the M.P.’s great-great-grandparents’ eldest son. The living Hinchliffe learned of the accident while researching his family history. That personal connection can collapse the distance from now to then: For Hinchliffe, the event could have the intensity, the immediacy, of disaster.

This is the difference between a disaster and an accident, between a school shooting and the everyday murders and suicides that add up to tens of thousands of gun deaths every year, few of them registering on the national consciousness. Disasters are public events that feel personal.

It’s why people remember where they were on 9/11, and some even claim to remember watching the first plane strike on TV that morning — an impossible memory, since the only known footage of the event was captured accidentally and was not on the news that day. We don’t have perfect recall for traumatic events: Studies have shown that our memories change and degrade over time, new information bleeding into them. But we see clips of disasters over and over — the tall, forked plume of the Challenger explosion, the second plane disappearing sleekly into the South Tower. Repetition gives these iconic, smoke-in-the-sky images the intimacy of memories. They confuse our personal history.

The spectacle of this media attention can be dangerous: School shootings and suicides often happen in clusters, one inspiring another. The constant horror of grim news can numb us to its significance. And while some events are turned into high-resolution dramas, others are, inevitably, ignored, too distant or abstract to make an impression.

By the end of that BBC story, readers learned that John Hinchliffe was just 8 years old when he fell about 17 stories to his death on the floor of a mine. Seeing the scale of it — the small boy and the very long fall — makes it feel more visceral, more known. This is both the power and the danger of “disaster”: It lets you choose what becomes real and immediate, and what stays far away."
When Love Seems Too Easy to Trust,"I read online accounts of broken engagements, identifying signs and symptoms, my heart pounding the way it does when I wake up with a stiff neck and read the meningitis page on WebMD.

Part of the problem is I met Joe when I was 22, when I believed the romantic comedy of my life (based on “When Harry Met Sally”) hadn’t started yet. More accurately, I was in the flashback phase of that rom-com: Harry and Sally driving from Chicago to New York together.

For a time, whenever I liked someone, I would try to game out the circumstances that would force us on an extended road trip, which would set the stage for us reuniting at some unimaginable age, like 27. By then my stock would have risen. I would be thinner and more successful, possibly even famous. I would have the necessary collateral to ask for what I wanted.

I envisioned this scenario with several men, not one of whom gave any indication of being a viable long-term prospect. There was the guy who said, “I value our friendship too much” but would begin pawing at me when we were alone; the guy I’d go home drunk with throughout college (but only when it was his idea); and the guy who would come to my apartment late at night to get stoned and lecture me about Radiohead.

These quasi relationships were accompanied by hours of texting or G-chatting that mostly involved me being an attentive sounding board. The challenge of trying to impress thrilled and unnerved me.

I would hungrily read back through our witty exchanges, congratulating myself on points I had scored. Doing so would convince me that, like in a rom-com, I had met the love of my life. Hell, I’d already slept with him! But it wasn’t the right time for us to be romantically involved. We still had at least five years to go before we would reunite. (That I envisioned this fantasy with multiple men seemed like a smarter bet, diversification.)

In movies, if a man is looking only for sex he is a cad. If he wants to talk, he’s interested in something more. It took me years to understand that men can want any combination of sex and conversation while having zero interest in a relationship.

The scant attention I received from these men felt safer than asking for more. Also, it was dramatic: My whole life was a “Will we or won’t we?”

And then I met Joe at a bar. He talked to my friends and me and asked for my phone number. Watching him tipsily jab at his screen, I told him to call my phone to make sure he had typed correctly. He hadn’t, so I typed it in. He texted two days later.

Joe fell into my lap so casually that I thought nothing of it. I considered dating him to be a good use of time while I worked on becoming that more valuable person for someone else.

Joe was 30, I learned. We each suspected an age difference, but this eight-year gulf surprised us. I had grown up on Disney Channel Original Movies and the earliest viral videos. Joe had seen almost every network sitcom — “Cheers,” “Malcolm in the Middle,” you name it. We overlapped on “Friends.” He would say things like, “Did you know ‘Roseanne’ had one of the first same-sex kisses on network television?” I had not.

We talked about our favorite movies and I told him the truth, that mine was the 1994 “Little Women” adaptation. I told him how much I loved the Olive Garden and lamented that the Times Square location was too busy and expensive. He told me about his dogs, a Boston terrier (Pez) and a miniature dachshund (Little Buddy).

On the phone to my mother during those early weeks, I told her that Joe seemed to like me an unprecedented amount, and this filled me with a surprising dread. “It seems too easy,” I told her.

There was no drama with us. No “Will we or won’t we?” Just a “We are.”

“Let it be easy,” my mother said.

I worried because my text conversation with Joe rarely fell into that rapid-fire rhythm I found so thrilling. But I also wasn’t performing for him.

In July, we went to Vermont on our first vacation together. One evening, after we had done the requisite frolicking in nature, I asked Joe what he wanted for dinner.

He looked at me slyly and said, “How about the Olive Garden?”

I threw my arms around him.

On the drive, I burped in front of him for the first time. I remember it happening in slow motion, including the part where I cried out “No!” right after. When I recovered, Joe told me that the first night he stayed at my apartment, I fell asleep on his chest and drooled all over him.

Joe said “I love you” first. I said it back, then retreated into my own head. In all of my scheming before Joe, I had never conceived of a situation in which I would have the power to break someone’s heart. I had assumed the man would have that power and my life would be a constant charm offensive to stop him from using it. I thought when someone said “I love you” to me, it would be the result of my hard work or even trickery.

“What’s going on in that dome of yours?” Joe asked as we stood on my building’s fire escape. This is truly how he speaks.

“I don’t want to say it,” I said.

“You can say it.”

“I’m freaked out because I can imagine a day that I wind up hurting you,” I said. “Not that I have any plans, but the potential exists, and I can’t imagine it the other way around.” This is truly how I speak.

Joe said: “There’s an episode of ‘Malcolm in the Middle’ where Lois is upset because Hal loves her a little more than she loves him. He tells her it’s O.K. because two people can’t love each other that much. If they did, they’d never leave the house.”

We had one big fight that first year. I was dusting a ceiling fan in his apartment and he got angry that I was doing it in his prized Black Sabbath T-shirt. I stormed out of the apartment and walked to the subway.

“I guess we’re going to break up,” I thought. “It’s not like he’s going to chase me to the F train.” I needed to refill my MetroCard but had only pressed the first button when I felt him tap me on the shoulder.

I’m 27 now, the age I imagined I would be when one of those guys from my past would realize I was the One. In some ways, I am the version of myself I hoped I would be. I am more successful, by virtue of being six years out of college. I’m a little thinner, though I try to think about that less.

I sometimes wonder how I would do on the dating market now, imagining Harry and Sally reunions with those indifferent men from my past. I’m in touch with a few of them and, to be honest, they don’t seem to be pining.

I try to remember that I am worthy of anyone, but mostly that I am worthy of Joe. It’s common for a woman to have that kind of realization at the end of a movie, to discover she was enough all along. But what the movies get wrong is that once the character realizes this, she is transformed forever. In real life, I have to keep reminding myself."
Hot Jazz in a Veterans Club Basement in Harlem,"On a Sunday afternoon in February, the staccato chords and rousing bass lines of a Hammond B-3 organ shook the walls of American Legion Post 398 in Harlem.

Ba-ba-doo-dee-dee-deep. Bum-ba-ba-ba-bummm.

Hundreds of people had crammed into the humble basement bar to pay tribute to the organ’s owner, the musician Seleno Clarke, who had died in December at 87.

Some said prayers. Some read poems. But mostly they played jazz.

From 3 in the afternoon until 11 p.m., dozens of organists, saxophonists, guitarists, drummers and singers rotated onto the modest stage. They played with verve and abandon, as the crowd hooted and clapped and cried out, “Seleno!”

It might have been a strange sight for an American Legion post. The veterans service organization has struggled to keep up membership nationwide, but Post 398’s reputation as one of the last authentic jazz venues in Harlem has kept its seats full and the atmosphere popping. Every Sunday night for nearly two decades, an unlikely mix of aging veterans, tourists and musicians from around the world have come to enjoy cheap drinks, Southern-style home cooking and jazz.

Legion members say Mr. Clarke’s death left an irreplaceable gap in their close-knit community. Today, the organist can still be spotted smiling, always wearing a suit, in many of the photos lining Post 398’s yellow and blue walls. But Mr. Clarke’s former bandmates, on a mission to uphold his legacy, are tightening their sound, broadening their repertory and playing with more enthusiasm than ever.

“Seleno brought people together with his music,” said David Lee Jones, 59, a veteran alto saxophonist who played with Mr. Clarke for 27 years and who now fills his old mentor’s shoes as bandleader. “We want to keep that going. We want to keep jazz going here in Harlem.”"
"Opinion | Colleges Recruit at Richer, Whiter High Schools","Mr. Jaquette is an assistant professor at U.C.L.A. Ms. Salazar is a doctoral candidate at the University of Arizona.

Colleges like to tout their commitment to diversity, but the way they recruit students tells a different story.



For example, the typical high school visited by Connecticut College during recruitment events was richer and whiter than the typical high school they didn’t visit. An analysis of 41 other colleges and universities shows a similar trend: high schools that were visited for recruiting events tended to be whiter and wealthier than schools that were not visited.

The findings come from newly collected data on high school recruitment visits, when colleges send representatives across the country to court potential students. We gathered data on these visits throughout 2017 for 150 colleges and universities. (The data does not include other forms of recruitment like brochures, emails and visits not posted online. It also cannot account for instances where a high school may lack the capacity to host recruitment events.)

Knowing which high schools receive recruiting visits is important because debates about access to higher education often focus on students’ abilities but ignore how colleges identify and prioritize prospects.

A study by Meagan Holland at the University at Buffalo found recruitment visits aren’t merely an indicator of each college’s priorities; they also influence where students — and particularly first-generation students — apply and enroll. The study found that many smart kids from less affluent backgrounds are sensitive to “feeling wanted,” often attending colleges that took the time to visit.

High Schools Receiving Visits Were in Wealthier Neighborhoods

The clearest finding from our study is that public high schools in more affluent neighborhoods receive more visits than those in less affluent areas.

Only about a third of households across the country earn more than $100,000 annually, but nearly half of high schools receiving visits by private colleges and universities were in neighborhoods where average incomes were higher. Connecticut College visited neighborhoods with an average median household income of $121,578. Private colleges also disproportionately visited private high schools over public high schools.

Andy Strickler, dean of admissions at Connecticut College, said the school targets high schools that have historically provided students, or other schools that have a similar profile.

He said there was a good reason Connecticut College doesn’t always visit other areas: “There’s a trend for these students to stay closer to home for college.”

While public research universities visited rich and poor neighborhoods nearly equally when recruiting in their home states, they visited the same affluent high schools targeted by private colleges when recruiting elsewhere. Most public colleges also visited far more high schools out of state than in-state. The median income of areas where the University of Pittsburgh recruited out of state, for example, was $114,000, compared with $63,000 for areas that were not visited.

The attention public universities lavish on wealthy out-of-state schools is a response to state policy. Over the past decade, many states have cut funding for higher education, forcing public universities to become more dependent on tuition revenue. Research shows that public universities responded by enrolling more out-of-state students, who often pay two to three times more than state residents. And of course, only well-off students can afford that.

When Boulder visited the Chicago metro area, it did not tend to visit schools like East Chicago High School, where only 2 percent of students are white. Joshua Lott for The New York Times

Some people argue that poor students and students of color are less likely to attend college because they have lower grades or standardized test scores. But we found that colleges and universities tended to avoid visiting schools in poor areas even when those schools had a large number of students who had performed well on tests.

For example, when the University of Colorado Boulder visited public high schools in the Boston metropolitan area, it focused on schools in wealthy communities but skipped many poorer schools that had higher numbers of students scoring proficient in math.

In their out-of-state visits, our data also suggest, public universities were more likely to visit predominantly white public high schools than nonwhite schools with similar levels of academic achievement. For example, the University of Colorado Boulder visited Dover-Sherborn Regional High School, which is 88 percent white and has about 154 students with proficient math scores, according to the federal Department of Education. But it did not visit Brockton High School, where just 21 percent of students are white but about 622 students have proficient math scores.

“In order to be good stewards of our funding, we consistently recruit at schools that have historically given us applications,” said Colleen Newman, admissions director at Boulder. “Given our limited funding, we are unable to expand our traditional recruitment efforts to all regions and all high schools that have academically talented students.”

Recruitment Is Big Business

A recruiter for the University of Alabama speaks to prospective students at a college fair run by the National Association for College Admission Counseling, at Suffolk County Community College on Long Island. Michael Nagle for The New York Times

Colleges don’t treat recruitment lightly. It’s big business for colleges and the firms they hire. Most colleges identify prospects by purchasing lists of students and their backgrounds from the testing agencies College Board and ACT. They can also hire enrollment management consulting firms, which integrate data from the university with data on schools and communities. This helps them decide which schools should be visited and which should be targeted with emails and brochures. One consulting firm we spoke with even knows information about individual students such as their family income and net worth, and the value of their home.

If colleges have all this data, why aren’t they better at targeting talented poor students and students of color?

The most common explanation is that there aren’t enough of them applying (the so-called achievement gap). Another explanation we hear is that talented students don’t apply because they don’t have the right guidance (called “under-matching”). These explanations assume that doubling the number of high-achieving students who apply would automatically double enrollment. But this treats universities as though they are passively receiving applications, when they are actually actively seeking and encouraging certain applicants over others. Our data suggests universities are determined to court wealthier students over others, and they expend substantial resources identifying and reaching them.

There are many students from poor communities who get excellent grades but end up going to a community college because no one bothers looking for them. If colleges are serious about increasing socioeconomic and racial diversity, they should look for merit everywhere, not just in wealthy, white communities.

Opinion | Mike Pompeo Works the Hill,"Given their differences, it’s hard to believe that Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director and secretary of state nominee whose Senate confirmation hearing was Thursday, and Rex Tillerson, who was fired last month, were both chosen by President Trump.

Mr. Tillerson, the former chief executive officer of ExxonMobil, left a legacy as the worst secretary of state in modern memory by cutting the department’s budget, forcing out scores of senior diplomats and marginalizing those who remained, leaving many top jobs vacant and cloistering himself with a small coterie of aides unfamiliar with the institution.

He focused too much time on bureaucratic restructuring rather than addressing the job’s core mission — handling international crises and representing America on the world stage. In the process, he, along with Mr. Trump, weakened democracy and human rights as elements of American diplomacy and undermined the nation’s global leadership role.

Mr. Pompeo, a former Tea Party congressman from Kansas, described, over several hours before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday, an approach that would repudiate much of what Mr. Tillerson had done. He said his first priority was to ensure that State Department employees, demoralized under Mr. Tillerson, were empowered and had a clear understanding of Mr. Trump’s goals."
Opinion | The Paul Ryan Story: From Flimflam to Fascism,"Why did Paul Ryan choose not to run for re-election? What will be the consequences? Your guess is as good as mine — literally. I can speculate based on what I read in the papers, but so can you.

On the other hand, I do have some insight into how Ryan — who has always been an obvious con man, to anyone willing to see — came to become speaker of the House. And that’s a story that reflects badly not just on Ryan himself, not just on his party, but also on self-proclaimed centrists and the news media, who boosted his career through their malfeasance. Furthermore, the forces that brought Ryan to a position of power are the same forces that have brought America to the edge of a constitutional crisis.

About Ryan: Incredibly, I’m seeing some news reports about his exit that portray him as a serious policy wonk and fiscal hawk who, sadly, found himself unable to fulfill his mission in the Trump era. Unbelievable.

Look, the single animating principle of everything Ryan did and proposed was to comfort the comfortable while afflicting the afflicted. Can anyone name a single instance in which his supposed concern about the deficit made him willing to impose any burden on the wealthy, in which his supposed compassion made him willing to improve the lives of the poor? Remember, he voted against the Simpson-Bowles debt commission proposal not because of its real flaws, but because it would raise taxes and fail to repeal Obamacare."
Opinion | The Self-Destruction of Paul Ryan and the G.O.P.,"He promised never to cut their Social Security or Medicare, and expressed admiration for single-payer health care. He took their side against immigrant rapists, murderous jihadis, plundering trade deals, dangerous city people and disloyal, condescending elites of all parties and persuasions. He promised to use his billionaire superpowers to rig the economy to their advantage. It didn’t matter that he is a transparently corrupt, bigoted, sexually abusive, compulsive liar. He offered the dignity of recognition, promised to fight, and won.

Mr. Ryan, who had dreamed of building a more inclusive party, was sincerely horrified by Mr. Trump’s divisive white-identity politics. But there wasn’t anything he and the Republican establishment could do about it. They had nothing with which to fight the towering inferno of resentment they had kindled through their arrogant, ideologically driven indifference to the pressing needs of the people they claim to represent.

As soon as Mr. Trump clinched the nomination, Mr. Ryan became as tame as a poodle. Congressional leaders hoped that Mr. Trump’s need for political cover might make him tractable, and that unified government would enable them to finally set America on the path to broad-based prosperity through tax cuts, entitlement reform and the replacement of Obamacare with something no one had bothered to work out.

But the Republican majority was crippled from the start by the fundamental conflict between a government-shrinking agenda and the immediate material interests of Republican voters. Thus, the only thing Mr. Ryan has to show for his meekness in the face of Mr. Trump’s corruption and bigotry is an enormous tax cut that leaves the level of government spending basically untouched, except for interest payments on the debt, which the Congressional Budget Office now estimates will outstrip annual military spending in five years.

Meanwhile, Mr. Trump is bulldozing congressional Republicans into a mass grave. Democrats outnumber Republicans, so the latter depend on a sizable turnout advantage to win elections and sustain minority rule. But Mr. Trump’s brand of scapegoating demagogy, which Mr. Ryan as speaker has done nothing but enable, is a turbocharged Democratic turnout machine that converts swing districts into Democratic seats and converts enormous Republican advantages into razor’s edge contests. Barring a miracle, Republicans are going to lose their House majority, and even their Senate majority, once thought untouchable, is no longer safe.

So Mr. Ryan has cornered himself, and his party. The Republican base won’t buy what he’s selling, unless it’s awkwardly grafted onto white-identity populism, which is a self-annihilating strategy for mobilizing Democrats to the polls.

The forthcoming implosion of Mr. Ryan’s party, and his imminent retreat to Wisconsin, illustrates the danger of hidebound ideological overconfidence. Party elites in the grip of dogma can’t see the point of checking in with the people they represent and are blind to new problems the partisan catechism is not equipped to comprehend. If a decent Republican Party one day rises from the devastation Paul Ryan practically invited Donald Trump to inflict, it will be one that has stopped legislating for an imaginary world of self-financing tax cuts, having rediscovered and realigned with the basic interests of aging and working-class white suburban and rural American voters. It will take their woes seriously, and nurture their welfare, not their grievance."
Opinion | Does Math Make You Smarter?,"Does studying mathematics enhance your overall mental prowess?

Abraham Lincoln certainly believed so, embarking on the arduous task of mastering Euclid’s treatises on geometry to increase his cognitive capacities, in particular his linguistic and logical abilities. This idea — that mathematics strengthens your mind much as physical exercise strengthens your body, helping you negotiate a variety of mental challenges — goes all the way back to Plato. Alive and well in today’s world, it is one reason popularly given for why everyone should study mathematics.

So it can come as a surprise to learn that cognitive psychologists have a different take on the issue. Various studies point to the conclusion that subjecting the mind to formal discipline — as when studying geometry or Latin — does not, in general, engender a broad transfer of learning. There is no sweeping increase of a general capacity for tasks like writing a speech or balancing a checkbook.

But surely a narrower claim is true: that mathematics, so systematically built as it is on inference, must develop logical thinking. Right?

By “logical,” I mean the kind of thinking needed to solve the following problem:

Four cards are laid in front of you, each of which, it is explained, has a letter on one side and a number on the other. The sides that you see read E, 2, 5 and F. Your task is to turn over only those cards that could decisively prove the truth or falsity of the following rule: “If there is an E on one side, the number on the other side must be a 5.” Which ones do you turn over?"
Opinion | A Renaissance on the Right,"Identity politics gained traction on the left, but now the Trumpian right has decided to fight fire with fire. Populism is a form of identity politics because it’s based on in-group/out-group distinctions. It says anybody who doesn’t think or look like us is not a true American.

This tribal mentality is tearing the civic fabric and creates a war of what Goldberg thinks of as “ecstatic schadenfreude” — the exaltation people feel when tribal foes are brought down.

I love the way Goldberg provocatively tells his story, but I partially disagree with it. The central tension in his book is between Locke, who emerges as a rational, calm, pipe-smoking economist, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who emerges as a wild-haired, passionately resentful rock star. The liberal order emerges from the individualism of Locke and is threatened by group consciousness and romantic resentments of Rousseau.

But America is both rational and romantic, both Locke and Rousseau. We have a rationalist constitution, but we have a shared national faith and are an emotional community, rooted in our land, inspired by our history, warmed by the hope of our common future.

The core problem today is not tribalism. It’s excessive individualism, which has eaten away at our uniting faith and damaged our relationships with one another. Excessive individualism has left us distrustful and alone — naked Lockeans. When people are naked and alone they revert to tribe. Tribalism is the end product of excessive individualism.

Goldberg is suspicious of nationalism and has a tendency to think that any effort to build a national community puts you on the express lanes on the road to serfdom.

His conservatism is missing the bonding sentiments of Edmund Burke, and the idea that the little platoon of the family is nestled in the emotional platoon of the neighborhood and the emotional platoon of the nation. Tribalism is not the only way to form a group; there’s also the redeeming and forgiving love of community, and a shared national faith. Goldberg misses the way Hamilton, Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt built a national community that didn’t crush local communities but rather reinforced them.

Goldberg is right to fight tribalism on the left and the right. But you can’t reweave a fragmented nation by appealing just to Lockean individualism. Gratitude is too weak a glue to hold a diverse nation together. Renewal will come through the communitarians on the right and the left, who seek ways to improve relationships on a household, local and national level."
Opinion | Will Democrats Win the House? Ask Texas,"“We’ve seen a level of activism here that is off the charts,” he told me after a town hall in Dallas where he spoke with voters about the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., and the need for gun-safety legislation. Sessions is a major recipient of donations from the National Rifle Association, and Allred, echoing the campaigns of Democrats across the country, is making an issue of that.

The mere existence of the runoffs that he, Jones and other Texas Democrats will compete in next month reflects Democrats’ hopes in Texas in 2018, because it means that there were three or more Democratic candidates in districts that had two, one or none in election cycles past.

“Democrats smell blood in the water,” Harold Cook, a former executive director of the Texas Democratic Party, told me, “and for the first time in maybe forever, there is a Democrat running in every single congressional district in Texas, including ones where it’s a ludicrous thought that a Democrat could conceivably win.” They’re that angry about Trump and that convinced that his turbulent presidency and failure to nudge his approval rating much above 40 percent could mean an enormous blue wave.

Democrats are even eyeing a few districts that Trump won, like the 21st and 31st. The 21st attracted the party’s attention largely because its Republican incumbent, Lamar Smith, isn’t seeking re-election. He decided to retire after more than three decades in the House.

And the 31st? Well, it’s hard not to indulge in some optimism when your party’s leading candidate is a female war hero whose story is possibly becoming a movie, “Shoot Like a Girl,” starring Angelina Jolie. That candidate, M. J. Hegar, 42, did several tours of duty in Afghanistan as a search-and-rescue pilot and won a Purple Heart after she was wounded while saving fellow passengers when the Taliban shot down her helicopter.

Richard Murray, a professor of political science at the University of Houston, told me to keep an eye as well on the 22nd District, a largely suburban swath of the Houston area that he described as a microcosm of demographic changes that are making the state ever more hospitable Democratic turf.

“The suburban counties that led Republicans to dominance here 25 years ago are getting significantly less Republican fast,” he said, adding that Fort Bend County, in the 22nd, is roughly 20 percent Asian-American now. The first-place finisher in the district’s Democratic primary, Sri Preston Kulkarni, is Indian-American. Murray said that if Kulkarni wins his runoff, that could be a significant boost to Democrats’ chances to nab this House seat.

Trump took the 22nd by almost 8 points. But Mitt Romney won it four years earlier by more than 25. And bear in mind that Lamb notched his Pennsylvania victory last month in a district that had gone for Trump by a margin of 19 points."
Opinion | Tethered to a Raging Buffoon Called Trump,"We are tethered to a buffoon. He rages and veers, spreading ugliness, like an oil slick smothering everything in its viscous mantle. He’s about to bomb Syria. He’s not about to bomb Syria. His attention span is nonexistent. He attacks the foundations of our Republic: an independent judiciary, a free press, truth itself. His cabinet looks terrorized, the way Saddam Hussein’s once did.

President Donald Trump is dangerous. The main things mitigating the danger are his incompetence and cowardice. We live in a time that teaches how outrage can turn to a shrug, how the unthinkable repeated over and over can induce moral numbness, how a madman’s manic certainties can overwhelm reason. He is very busy; people resist; he opens another front; people shake their heads. It’s hard to remember on Friday what happened on Monday. Trump’s is the unbearable lightness of the charlatan.

Disorientation spreads. Trump’s main war, beyond all the military bluster, is on truth. This reflects his instinct for the jugular: Once the distinction between truth and falsehood disappears, anything is possible. There are plenty of examples these days, from Moscow to Budapest, of how “democracies” can be manipulated to the point where they can yield only one result. This is Trump’s objective, and for it he needs a weakened Justice Department, a weakened press and an American public that will believe anything. He has had setbacks but is stubborn.

In the mid-1930s, when the world was hurtling toward disaster, Robert Musil, the Austrian author of “The Man Without Qualities,” wrote this on the nature of civilization: “That which we call culture presumably does not directly have the concept of truth as a criterion, but no culture can rest on a crooked relationship to truth.”"
"Opinion | Madeleine Albright Is Worried. We Should Be, Too.","Madeleine Albright, the former secretary of state, was born into a totalitarian age. She was only a toddler when she and her parents, who were of Jewish descent but later converted to Catholicism, fled Czechoslovakia after Hitler’s invasion in 1939. They returned following the war, but fled again in the wake of the Communist coup in 1948.

Her father, the diplomat Josef Korbel, sought asylum for the family in the United States, writing in a letter to an American official that if they returned home he’d be arrested “for my faithful adherence to the ideals of democracy.” America took them in as refugees. Korbel became an eminent foreign policy scholar, and in 1997 Bill Clinton made Albright the country’s chief diplomat, the first woman to hold that position.

At the time, the Cold War was over and the great ideological battles of the 20th century appeared settled. Liberal democracy was ascendant, and Albright’s adopted country was its most powerful champion. The arc of her life seemed to coincide with a global evolution from widespread tyranny toward expanding freedom.

So it is sad and jarring that Albright, now 80, has just published a book with the stark title “Fascism: A Warning.” The book is not just a warning about Donald Trump; Albright is concerned with the eclipse of liberal democracy all over the world and told me in a recent interview that she had planned to write on the subject before Trump’s election. But the president looms over her project. “If we think of fascism as a wound from the past that had almost healed, putting Trump in the White House was like ripping off the bandage and picking at the scab,” she writes."
Opinion | Tax Dollars for Napping,"I want to be proud of how my money is spent, not afraid that it can and will be used against me.

The biggest stuff — gazillions for defense, massive subsidies for agriculture conglomerates, a down payment on the vanity border wall — just seems beyond my capacity for targeted outrage.

It’s the small change that rattles my civic soul. Take Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency dismantler in chief — please. The first-class travel on my dime, the $42,000 to build a super secret phone booth, the attempt to drop $70,000 on two desks — enough! But now we find out he wanted to use a siren in his bulletproof, taxpayer-financed auto fleet to get to dinner at his favorite French restaurant, Le Diplomate.

Because of Pruitt’s paranoia, his security detail costs about $3 million a year. Do you know how many trails the National Park Service could repair with that? Well, of course you do, you’re The Government. And those millions don’t include the door — $2,460 to replace — that was broken down when Pruitt’s bodyguards mistook an afternoon nap for a medical emergency. Which raises the question: Why are they guarding his naps?

If Pruitt truly needed dictator-level security and motorcades, he wouldn’t fly coach when he’s traveling on his own dime. He gouges us because Trump thinks he’s doing an outstanding job not enforcing clean air and water laws.

“I hate what they do with our tax money!” That was Trump in 2016. Now he’s on track to spend more of our money on leisure travel than any president, ever. In the first 13 months of his presidency, it cost us about $40 million in flights and security for him to go to Mar-a-Lago on weekends. When he golfs at his place in Bedminster, N.J., it’s almost a million per trip, all costs included. The Secret Service is spending $100,000 on golf cart rentals alone.

What would make me feel a little better is if someone there in The Government would finish Trump’s audit so he can release his tax return, as promised two years ago. When you audited me, I sat down with a nice lady and a calculator, and we finished up before my coffee got cold. But then, I didn’t have nearly as many cryptic business expenses marked “other.”

If any problems arise with my return, please contact Mark Zuckerberg, as he knows more about me than I do.

Sincerely, A Taxpayer."
Opinion | Of Course Trump Can Fire Mueller. He Shouldn’t.,"Mr. Trump declared that “attorney-client privilege is dead” and denounced the search as “a witch hunt.” He added of Mr. Mueller that “many people have said you should fire him.” As usual, the president left the nation in suspense: “We’ll see what happens.”

Mr. Trump can fire the special counsel for the search, for exceeding the original mandate of his investigation, or for no reason at all. Because the Constitution charges the president with the duty to “take care that the laws are faithfully executed,” Mr. Trump serves as the top federal law enforcement officer. If he disapproves of the execution of the law by subordinate Justice Department officers, he can remove them. Presidents can not only direct all federal prosecutions, as they have from the days of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, they also can drop cases for wasting resources.

But critics insist that Mr. Mueller enjoys protection under Justice Department regulations, which provide that the special counsel may be “removed from office only by the personal action of the attorney general” for “misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for other good cause.”

According to this view, Mr. Trump must convince Rod Rosenstein, the acting attorney general, to fire Mr. Mueller. If Mr. Rosenstein refuses, Mr. Trump can fire him and replace him with someone willing to do the dirty work. Alternatively, the president could order Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has recused himself from the Mueller probe, to rescind the regulations, which date back to 1999, and then fire Mr. Mueller.

But this narrow view of the president’s options rests on a misunderstanding of basic constitutional principles. Ever since the founding, presidents, Congresses and the Supreme Court have recognized that the chief executive has constitutional power to remove executive officers. As James Madison noted in 1789: “Is the power of displacing an executive power? I conceive that if any power whatsoever is in its nature executive, it is the power of appointing, overseeing, and controlling those who execute the laws.” In Myers v. U.S. (1926), the Supreme Court observed “it was natural, therefore, for those who framed our Constitution to regard the words ‘executive power’ as including” the power to remove executive officers."
Opinion | Goodbye to the House My Grandmother Built,"In those years, other nearby villas were sold and demolished, and the cityscape around us drastically changed. High-rises replaced gardens, two or three to a single plot of land. Our house was sought after — not for its architectural value, but because developers saw it as sitting on prime land along the Nile. Second to buying it out ourselves, which we couldn’t afford, placing it in the hands of a buyer who would preserve it was the best we could do, and that task became a mission for my mother, pitting her against her family in a standoff that lasted 30 years.

In my early 20s, as the country was beginning to reform economically and I was starting to write, I moved downstairs, inhabiting my grandmother’s floor, and my brother and I took on the cause of protecting the house ourselves. We searched widely for possible patrons who might make our home their own or turn it into a cultural center, a library or a museum. The interest that came, when it did, was always from abroad. Egyptian businessmen and patrons of culture seemed intent on investing in new developments, suburbs and multimillion-dollar modern homes, but not the center of the historic city, not the heritage already there.

For 30 years the garden bell rang with real estate agents promising “respectable” buyers. Every deal fell through, and it seemed like the house might stay in this limbo forever. I wrote the house into my novel in 2014: It was the only true-to-life character in the book, and the only thing in my life, and the neighborhood, that seemed unchanged through the revolution of 2011, as our hopes for real change after Mubarak’s fall first rose only soon to be shattered. Ours was the last of family homes still inhabited by its original owners, and everyone remarked how it was the one thing that they could depend on always being there.

And yet, when I wrote it into fiction, I conjured the moment where we might, indeed, pack it up.

On April 1, the day that President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s re-election was confirmed, we handed the house to its new owners, who had circled it for two years, admiring it. My mother had at last found her buyer, a woman whom she felt would be the next best custodian to the house and its legacy. We walked through its every room together on that last day, and once the handover papers were signed in the garden, I returned inside alone to close all the doors, windows and shutters. I then led myself out of the main door, locking it behind me.

Those final moments walking out, as well as the months that preceded — as we sifted through nearly 80 years of a family history, packing and throwing out and giving things away — felt like a closing, the end of an era, both for my family and for modern Egypt, independent since 1922. The house now has foreign owners, and the country — perhaps at its most conservative and repressive — is a far cry from what I ever expected it to become. The latest elections came and went, for me, unacknowledged, too farcical to consider. What might have been a turning point, a political opening, became an end.

My mother’s new apartment overlooks her old garden; from her balcony, I see what used to be mine. The new owners haven’t moved in yet, but their groundsman and his family occupy the basement of our old house, and spend their days sitting on the plastic garden chairs we left behind. When the sun is setting, shutters left open offer a glimpse into my brother’s childhood bedroom; I forgot to roll them down, and the room’s white muslin curtains still hang. I feel shut out of our home, my lifelong prism into the city, and out of the future of this country."
Opinion | Comey vs. Trump: Fighting Words,"DORIS FENIG, FLORAL PARK, N.Y.

To the Editor:

Re “Trump Calls Comey ‘Untruthful Slime Ball’ as Book Details Released” (news article, nytimes.com, April 13):

When President Trump calls James Comey an “untruthful slime ball,” he could just as easily be talking about himself.

Attacking Mr. Comey so vociferously may make political sense, especially when you cannot rebut his charges with the truth, but does this president really believe that the American people will side with him over a man who by all accounts has lived up to his sworn oath to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic?

MICHAEL SCOTT, SAN FRANCISCO

To the Editor:

Re “The Law Is Coming, Mr. Trump” (editorial, April 11):

To this I can only add, “Please hurry.” No one should be surprised if within the coming days President Trump embroils us in some sort of international or domestic crisis in order to take the focus off his legal troubles. Either that, or he will simply fire Robert Mueller and prepare to ride out the storm.

The bottom line is, Mr. Trump has a real gift for self-survival and will stop at absolutely nothing, whatever the cost to the country or the Constitution, to ensure that survival. Having thwarted both the law and justice, he will then tweet his satisfaction at seeing the “witch hunt” brought to an end.

JOE ELLIOTT, ASHEVILLE, N.C.

To the Editor:

I am no fan of President Trump, but I believe he should be commended when he does the right thing. Your April 13 front-page article “Trump Weighs Rejoining Accord With Pacific Rim in About-Face” is good news. We should be stressing the potential positive outcomes from this decision (especially for American farmers) rather than the fact that it is an “about-face.”"
"Cute Shoes Are Useless, and Other Lessons From Three Months Traveling the World","I have some help with travel arrangements from The Times (and data scientists from Kayak, the travel aggregation site, who crafted an initial itinerary for me), so that’s taken a burden off. I try to make sure I have three days of activities in a place, and a full day of writing, plus two mornings for editing and fact-checking. That isn’t always possible so I’m often squeezing writing and social media into whatever spare moment I have.

I have two sacred times for myself: a weekly therapy call (this job is stressful!) and dinner. I’m willing to pull an all-nighter as long as I can have an hour of eating good food and sipping wine very slowly.

Most important, if I’m somewhere incredibly beautiful, I pause to take a mental image and be grateful. Who knows when I’ll be back to any of these places. That’s precious time, too, and I don’t want to waste it.

Packing for the journey

Q. How has your fast traveling pace streamlined your packing or the perception of what you “need”? - Shelley Steingraeber

Glad you asked, because I think about packing constantly! I’ll go over more of this in a separate packing article to come, but I’ve sent back maybe four shipments of stuff and the majority has been clothes. Cute dresses, cute shoes, cute jacket — all of it is gone.

What I’ve needed are items (mostly black) that can act as a uniform, layers to keep me warm, fast-drying underwear and a bra that won’t dig into me on the plane. Toiletries, I’m still carting around too many. I also joke that half the weight of my bag is tampons, but those aren’t going anywhere.

Favorite meals

Q. What country or place has your favorite typical breakfast, and what did you eat for breakfast there? - Elise Evans

Q. What’s the best thing you’ve eaten? — Juliana Baldo Walker via Facebook

I’m combining these two because all roads in food satisfaction lead to Bogotá, Colombia. I would eat every meal I had there a million times over.

Photo

The Click Clack Hotel, where I stayed for a few nights, had hands down the best breakfast of the trip. Nothing crazy, just omelets done well, strong coffee and platters of exotic fruits.

I also went to the Plaza 7 de Agosto market and got this insane fruit cocktail called a salpicón, which is mango, papaya, banana and watermelon bathed in a purée of papaya and watermelon. Also, arepas de choclo at brunch (sweet corn cakes with cheese) — yum. The best of the bunch was the lulada, a drink made out of lulo, a tart fruit that grows in Colombia and Ecuador. Eat it with a spoon, die of happiness.

(For future breakfasts, I’m looking forward to France and Italy, always, and China. Love egg and tomato and any breakfast foods with a kick of soy sauce.)

Surprises along the way

Q. What has been a surprising discovery for you at any of your locations so far? An unexpected turn of events, a detour, a random act of kindness? - Shelley Steingraeber

When I think of surprises, San Juan, Puerto Rico, is the first that comes to mind. I was eager to go there to see the Hurricane Maria damage for myself, and also to see if there was a way that, in writing about it, I could help out somehow. The hotel stock was so depleted that I was still scrambling to find a room when my plane took off. (I ended up booking an Airbnb, but just barely.)

So I was pretty stressed out when I got there. But the first thing I encountered was a bunch of women dancing around and singing by baggage claim. And through that encounter, I met everyone I hung out with on that trip. People were dealing with so much trauma and loss and yet I was welcomed into homes, onto farms, at parties.

I hope everyone gets a chance to experience the warmth of Puerto Rico as I did.

Health and sanity

Q. How are you keeping yourself healthy and sane during the many hours of alone time? - Sara Brenneis

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The healthy part, I’m not sure I’m succeeding at. So. Many. Carbs! So. Little. Exercise.

My mind, I have a better handle on. I’ve cried a few times, and felt quite overwhelmed, but that’s what phone calls to my therapist in New York City are for.

I’d like to tell you I’m finally watching “Breaking Bad,” but mostly I unwind with TV shows that don’t require much thinking (“The Bachelor,” “Queer Eye,” the entire first season of “The Good Doctor”). Phone-a-friend is always a good option. I have a few folks on Instagram — and folks I’ve met while traveling — who have become pen pals.

And a friend encouraged me to talk into voice memos as a feelings diary, which I did a ton while driving hours by myself on dirt roads in Chile. Essentially, my iPhone is my Wilson.

Traveling alone, as a woman

Q. I realize that solo female travel is becoming a much more common thing. Have you encountered any discrimination, uncomfortable sexualized situations, or barriers due to being a solo woman on the road? - Elise Evans

I definitely encountered tons of uncomfortable sexualized situations when I was in my late teens and 20s and traveling solo. Either I’m getting too old to get hit on or sadly, I’ve gotten used to it. So far, nothing overt has happened, other than some construction workers in Chile relentlessly asking about my marital status. I let it slide because it just didn’t seem worth the energy expenditure.

Q. What would you recommend to young women solo travelers who love off-the-beaten-path destinations and enjoying night life, but still want to remain cautious and safe? - Livia Halltari

When you say “young,” I’m assuming you mean young enough to handle slightly rugged lodging. I’d stay in hostels. They have a community around them, and you can form a buddy system with other solo female travelers. Hotels make it harder to have those kinds of interactions.

Photo

When you’re out, keep yourself on a two-drink regimen, for your sake and your buddy’s, be mindful of being slipped drugs, and always have the club or restaurant call you a taxi home, unless you’re ride-sharing and feel O.K. with that.

About off-the-path destinations, I think the safest thing you can do is always make sure someone knows where you are: the innkeeper, plus a parent or a close friend who will know to sound the alarm if you go off the grid for too long.

Safety is a huge concern for women (and often people of color and other minority groups), and I’m not sure everyone gets that. Trust your gut and be as cautious as you feel like you need to be, even if people make fun of you.

The worst trouble I’ve gotten into while traveling has been when I’ve tried to act like a local. Hang out with locals, but remember you’re always a potential target.

And try to have fun. It’s possible, I promise!

Q. What has been the easiest and hardest thing, specifically about solo travel, as a woman? - Ashley Zari

Hardest: Definitely safety concerns. There’s a patina of anxiety that coats me every time I go out in an urban environment — especially since I’m doing so much work with a phone and a camera that are ripe for getting snatched. It’s infinitely better to walk around with someone else, not just for the warmth of companionship, but also to have the chance to relax into my environment a bit.

Easiest: Not having to compromise and be on anyone else’s schedule (except for my editor’s). That probably says something about why I’m still single!

Advice for older women

Q. What advice do you give for an older woman (healthy, but 70), traveling alone? - Alyn Caulk

Hi Alyn, if you are the older woman in question, I say mazel! Happy to have a fellow adventuress on the road.

Tour groups and activities like cooking classes are great ways to make friends while maintaining the independence of traveling alone. Europe by bicycle is my favorite way to see the countryside, and all the trips I’ve taken have included active seniors.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

This time around, I’ve hired private guides for wilderness hikes, both for the company and a fail-safe should anything go wrong.

Also, say hi to the 30- and 40-somethings you meet. Chances are we think you’re very cool.

Traveling as a woman of color

Q. Can you write about what it’s like to travel alone as a woman, and even more so, what it’s like for a person of color perhaps? Many articles and blogs I find of solo female travel are white women, and I think their privilege plays into a lot of their experiences, especially positive ones on the road.

As an Asian woman who blends in easily in many eastern and Southeast Asian countries and has traveled to many of them, I always worry about how I’m perceived and treated by locals. - Emily L

Hi Emily! I’m half Chinese, but I don’t read as “Asian” in China, so I can’t speak to your experience of being able to blend. Chinese people can spot the pale, not-so-skinny American in me right away. I have, however, seen my dad encounter confusion and surprise that he doesn’t speak the language. He’s a scientist and is antisocial (sorry, Dad, it’s true!), so he mostly runs off, which seems like a fine enough policy to me.

The phenomenon of young white women writing about travel being easy doesn’t seem as noticeable to me as young white men doing it. As you’ve seen, a good deal of the questions here are women asking about safety while traveling solo. It’s a pervasive concern and every time I don’t see it mentioned in another writer’s article, I feel a bit of a disconnect — as I’m sure some people from other backgrounds feel while reading my work.

Photo

I, for one, would love to experience what it’s like to pass as an Asian local, to not be immediately marked as a tourist, to fly under the radar and observe subcultures unnoticed. Think of it as a blessing. Maybe you’ll get some weird looks when people figure things out, but by that time, you’ll be at an underground karaoke party.

The bigger issue here seems to be that you aren’t finding writing out there that jibes with your experience. It sounds like you want to change that. I’d definitely be a reader.

Friendly spots for singles

Q. As a single person who would love to make these stops someday, I would be curious to learn which places are single traveler friendly. Not just in terms of safety, but places where you can walk into a bar or hotel, or roam a beach or village, and random people would want to be your friend, chat with you, and even invite you to dine with them. - ND

Well, I’m glad you’re not asking about the dating scene, because I’ve sadly had no time for that!

Any kind of resort destination, for me, has been the hardest as a single person. I felt pretty out of place at Disney Springs, which is made for families, couples, and gaggles of friends drinking around the world at Epcot. Peninsula Papagayo in Costa Rica, San José del Cabo in Mexico, and even where I’m staying now in Rogue River, Ore., all seem geared toward couples vacations.

The easiest time I’ve had making friends was on the adventure travel circuit of Chile, or any time I’ve taken a tour. Activities are bonding; you’ll likely find other single folks with similar interests. And the line, “Hey, so I’m traveling the world by myself, where are you from?” seems to work wonders at starting conversations.

Language barriers

Q. How have you been able to overcome language barriers? — Lorene Lynn, writing from Utqiagvik, Alaska, via Instagram

So far I’ve been lucky in that the only language I’ve been required to speak, other than English, has been Spanish. I’m pretty rusty, but it’s a language I started studying in first grade, as a requirement of New Mexico public schools — and I improved a lot over the course of my travels in Latin America. I’ll be O.K. in places with French and Italian, too.

Most places, I’ve befriended native speakers who know English and have been happy to volunteer as interpreters.

In my first instance of trying to talk to someone who spoke zero English, we spoke into Google Translate on my phone.

Dangerous locations

Q. Is this trip going to bring you into any overt danger? — Michael Erard via Twitter

Not that I know of, but political situations around the world change all the time, and quickly. I was vacationing in Delhi when the 2008 Mumbai attacks happened, and I was visiting a friend during several bombings in Kabul over Thanksgiving in 2012. Danger is real, but I’ve got a pretty great support network at The Times to help me keep an eye on it.

‘The essence of a place’

Q. Do you think you really can glean the essence of a place by spending at most just a week there? - Ben

Definitely not. But the word “essence” is interesting here. If we think of it as the diffuse aroma of a perfume, perhaps a scent you remember deep in your brain, then it may be possible.

I’ve been thinking a lot about the job of a travel writer and I agree with my colleague Lucas Peterson, who writes the Frugal Traveler column, that it may be to simply encourage the idea of travel as a good thing in the world.

So if I can give you, the reader, a detail to hang onto or tell a story that compels you travel to that place, or travel anywhere, then I’ve done my job."
"For Neil Patrick Harris, It Takes an Adult to Make a Kids’ Show","And yes, the twins are allowed to watch their father at work. “Of course, it’s probably not the perfect content because it’s pretty dark — a lot of slapping children and smoking cigarettes and trying to murder 14-year-olds,” he said with a vaguely maniacal chuckle after pouring himself a glass of Scotch at a New York photo studio. “I don’t know that that’s a conversation to have at the dinner table, but for us it’s a little bit different.”

Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.

So what is that, two fingers of Scotch?

No, not two fingers. [Measures against his index finger. And yes, it’s slightly over.] How dare you, ma’am.

Why don’t you take a sip and tell me where we are we in the Baudelaire tribulations?

The kids are still trying to evade Count Olaf, and the only difference is they’ve both grown about three inches, so we quickly reference how remarkably tall they’ve gotten. And there’s more action. The Baudelaires for the first few books are shuffled from location to location from protector to protector, and at this point realize that they’re on their own and have to take some personal action in order to get away from Olaf and stick together as a family. And that is a good fuel for the engine.

And Olaf?

He’s losing it as the series goes on. He’s Wile E. Coyote, frustrated that the Road Runner keeps getting out of his reach. So he’s tired and swinging roundhouse knockout punches, even though that’s not the best way to box. And that’s fun to play.

You’re unrecognizable as Olaf. And Olaf himself plays different characters. How much time do you spend in the makeup chair?

About two and a half hours. I start in the special-effects makeup trailer and do all the prosthetics. I have a big forehead piece that covers my eyebrows and a nose that goes on, and then they paint it to match my skin tone, airbrush the whole thing with wrinkles and spots and hand-paint bags under the eyes and capillaries. After that I get a three-piece unibrow, two muttonchops, a goatee and a two-piece wig. And then I get dressed, and I’m ready to go.

Whew.

As much time as I spend in the process of looking like Olaf, it pales in comparison to the workload that Louis and Malina have. They’re on set doing their scene, blocking and learning lines, and then they’re rushed to school to think only about honors biology. Then there’s a knock at the door, and they stop where they are and go recite dialogue and act stressed and emotional. Rinse and repeat all day long until they’re pumpkined, which is the term for when they’re wrapped.

You recently rented out a theater in your hometown, Albuquerque, N.M., so that locals could see “Love, Simon” free of charge.

It was a movie that I think is profound, about a gay high school student who is afraid to come out and falls in love, and I was really moved by just how pure it was. But that purity doesn’t have to be pretentious. It’s not “Brokeback Mountain”; it’s more “Sixteen Candles,” handled in such a confident, casual, easy way. So I got 111 people to see it, and hopefully they were moved by it and will tell their friends and pay it forward.

Talking about smart kids, you also host NBC’s “Genius Junior.” What’s the appeal?

It’s these remarkable kids that do the most amazing feats, who can spell “omnidirectional” backward as fast as you can say it and remember a shuffled deck of cards and know the Greyhound bus map. These are achievable goals that kids can accomplish. If it can be aspirational and inspirational and still watchable, then I’m happy to be the ringmaster of that circus.

Does it make you want to go home and quiz Harper and Gideon?

I’m having to shift into that parent. Not, certainly, spelling backward. But to get them to recognize that homework, that reading, that writing, isn’t something that they do for an hour until they can play — and so they’re excited to know that it doesn’t stop until you’re 80 and you have cataracts. So I’m on them to make sure they’re using sentence structure well, that they’re spelling things right, that their E’s look uniform. It’s time."
"Opinion | In India, Farmers Face a Terrifying Crisis","A waiver of their bank debt was among the key demands of the marchers in Mumbai. It would cost the state $5.23 billion — about $758 each for 6.9 million farmers. Another key demand was from farmers from the indigenous tribal communities who have for generations cultivated forest lands that are not officially vested in their names. They seek the implementation of India’s Forest Rights Act of 2006, which could confer them title deeds to those lands.

And the marchers, like all farmers across India, demanded minimum support prices for their produce at levels that governments have long promised. Prices received by farmers have seen repeated collapses. Dependence on the monsoon has been joined by an even sharper vulnerability to a rigged market. A severe water crisis, often driven more by unequal access than by poor rainfall, has further damaged agriculture.

The census in 2011 showed that for the first time since Indian independence in 1947, urban India added more people to its population than rural India did. Millions have left their villages for other villages, small towns and cities in search of jobs that are not there. As many male farmers moved out of their villages, the burdens of female farmers rose in ways numbers cannot capture. Between 1995 and 2015, the National Crime Records Bureau logged over 300,000 farmer suicides.

Successive governments have connived at and hastened the corporate hijacking of Indian agriculture, privileging the profits of a few over countless livelihoods. Millions of poor rural Indians whose transactions are almost entirely in cash were badly hurt after Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November 2016 banned two bills that account for a vast majority of all currency in circulation and decided to introduce new bills. The expansion of existing bans on cow slaughter wrecked the livelihoods of millions of farmers who bought and sold cattle.

Rural India’s deepening distress unfolds against the canvas of policy-driven inequality over the past two decades. The roughly five-member Indian farm household, according to the National Sample Survey Organization, a federal data collection agency, had an average monthly income of $99 in 2013.

The number of Indian billionaires on the Forbes annual list rose from 55 in 2011 to 121 in 2018. The collective net worth of our 121 billionaires was estimated by the magazine to be $440.1 billion, equal to roughly 22 percent of India’s gross domestic product. We now rank fourth in the world on the Forbes billionaires list and 131st on the United Nations Human Development Index.

The net worth of India’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, rose to $40.1 billion on the 2018 Forbes billionaires list from $23.2 billion in 2017. To cumulatively make the amount Mr. Ambani added to his income in a year, 18.7 million rural Indians working under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, the country’s flagship employment program, would have to work for 12 months without a day off.

Indian elites and rulers largely ignore rural distress except in election years and when it causes them embarrassment in the West, where they desperately seek acknowledgment and applause. But there are solutions they could turn to."
Why Teenagers Become ‘Allergic’ to Their Parents,"The son of a colleague stopped running with his dad once his membership on the cross-country team became the organizing force of his high school identity. The boy still ran, of course, but now with friends or alone. He could not, at least in the near term, feel separate from his father and still go out jogging with him.

In short, adults can find themselves in a season of parenting when nothing they do sits right with their teenagers.

While we wait for this season to pass, what should we do when our teenager can hardly stand how we operate our turn signals?

For starters, we might view it as a reassuring marker of normal development. While we know, intuitively, that our children will not always admire and enjoy us the way they often do when they are young, it’s easier to part with our pedestals when we remember that our adolescents’ new allergies herald the next chapter in our relationships with them.

View all New York Times newsletters.

From there, we can either ignore their annoyance or remind our children that they are free to be aggravated, but not rude. If necessary, we can gently point out that it won’t be long before they’ll be driving and operating the turn signals just as they please.

Finally, we can sometimes welcome teenage self-consciousness as an opportunity to connect. When I was growing up and a friend of mine’s allergy to his parents was at its absolute height, his mother would allow him to choose her outfit when they needed to attend school events together. Of course the case can be made against indulging adolescent hypersensitivities. But the case can also be made that eighth-grade orientation is already stressful enough. If wearing one sweater rather than another makes little difference to you, why not do what you can to ease your tween’s mind?

As for my colleague, he dearly missed going on runs with his son, just as many parents of adolescents long for the days when their preteen laughed at their jokes and happily came along on errands. We are rarely as ready to separate from our teenagers as they are ready to separate from us.

Even when you don’t take your child’s secession from your union personally, it still hurts. Having other interests and supportive relationships can help. Go out for coffee with friends whose teenagers also look at them askance and reassure your wife that she’s still got it, even if her dance moves do cause your ninth-grade daughter to break out in hives.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

For teenagers whose allergies manifest as persistent disrespect, laying down some ground rules can help. A wise friend of mine tells her adolescent son that he can be friendly, polite, or clear about needing some time alone; insolence, however, is off the table. And though it’s painful to be treated as an irritant, holding a grudge can sour those unexpected moments when even the most reactive teenager welcomes our company.

Once teenagers have had time and space to establish their own skills, interests and tastes, their allergic response to their parents usually dies down. Plus, neurological development is on our side. As they age, adolescents’ evolving cognitive capacities allow them to think beyond seeing their parents only as being like, or unlike, how they themselves want to be.

Now they can sort what they see in us into categories that could not exist before. We can have bothersome quirks that our teenagers view as entirely our own; we can have characteristics they admire, but don’t care to cultivate. And our teenagers can embrace interests that they happen to share with us.

Teenagers’ allergies to their parents may make a brief return at moments when they want tight control of their personal brands — such as during college visits, or when highly regarded peers are nearby. But at some point you may be able to return to blowing goodbye kisses without causing your teenager anything more than mild discomfort. And your dance moves might even get a little long overdue respect, too."
5 Cheap(ish) Things You Need in Your Bedroom,"Photo

Welcome to the Smarter Living newsletter. Editor Tim Herrera emails readers with tips and advice for living a better, more fulfilling life. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.

Tell me if this part of my bedtime routine sounds anything like yours.

Just as I notice myself drifting off to sleep, I nudge myself awake to set anywhere from five to 10 alarms on my phone in five-minute intervals; I make sure the volume on my phone is turned all the way up; I double-check that I just changed the ringer volume and not the regular volume; I double-check that my alarms are set even though I set them 90 seconds ago; and some nights, I’ll wake up just after falling asleep in a panic thinking I didn’t set any alarms, then go through the whole process again. (Not to mention the horror of thinking, What if my phone dies overnight and the alarms don’t go off?)

Sound familiar? (No really, tweet at me if this is you so I know I’m not just insane.)

That’s no way to live! If only there were some solution to this problem, some device that could take away all of that late-night anxiety …

Oh, dear reader, there is: an alarm clock! Who knew.

If you’re looking to pick one up to end all of that needless checking and rechecking (or you’re just ready for an upgrade), the best alarm clock for most people is the RCA RCD30 for just $11. So long, alarm anxiety.

Opinion | Has Latin America’s Crusade Against Corruption Gone Too Far?,"In Brazil, where independent judges have exercised a direct impact on the electoral process, have they not opened the way to extremist rabble-rousers like the conservative candidate Jair Bolsonaro, while simultaneously making the country ungovernable?

And are the calls for an internationally supported truth commission on corruption and human rights violations in Mexico a symptom of civil society being fed up with interminable scandals, or a menace to the country’s eternally weak justice system?

There are no simple answers to these questions. Any flat-out judgment, in either direction, is bound to be schematic and skewed. The facts on the ground are that with two or three exceptions — Uruguay, Chile and perhaps Costa Rica — no country in Latin America has ever been spared massive doses of corruption. Standing institutions alone have never functioned effectively either in wiping it out, diminishing it noticeably or taking action against impunity for corruption or human rights violations. Regarding the latter plague, for which the region has a dismal reputation even today, international cooperation of one sort or another has proved indispensable for bringing criminals to justice or at least naming and shaming them for generations to come. The best example lies probably in Guatemala, but also in Argentina, where former presidents of the Junta were indicted and jailed for human rights violations.

There appears to be no choice but to place any attempt to deal legally, democratically and effectively with the lack of punishment above other considerations: institution-building, national sovereignty, political stability, short-term economic performance. Developments over the past few years in all the region’s countries are positive, hopeful ones. In the end, they will strengthen civil society, representative democracy, the rule of law and economic progress. They do not weaken institutions; they help to transform them and make them function.

Similarly, taking corruption to a supranational level that must be addressed through international cooperation is not an abdication of sovereignty; it is a desirable change.

In fact, this is perhaps the most imaginative and productive route for the fight against corruption. It is, by definition, a transnational phenomenon: People who steal money hide it far from where they stole it.

The Odebrecht scandal, the Panama Papers, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the United States and the European Union’s equivalent legislation are all indicators of the need and the tradition of taking on corruption beyond strictly national borders. The inclusion of an anti-corruption chapter in the new Nafta currently being negotiated by Mexico, the United States and Canada is a step in the right direction. But much more has to be done with regard to this supranational approach."
A Fossilized Finger Bone May Be From the Earliest Humans on the Arabian Peninsula,"“This discovery of a fossil finger bone for me is like a dream come true because it supports arguments that our teams have been making for more than 10 years,” Michael Petraglia, an archaeologist from the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Germany and an author on the paper, which was published in Nature Ecology & Evolution, said during a media briefing.

“This find, together with other finds in the last few years, suggest that modern humans, Homo sapiens, are moving out of Africa multiple times during many windows of opportunity during the last 100,000 years or so,” he said.

Arabia was at the heart of that dispersal from Africa into Asia. But at the time when this ancient person lived, the Arabian Peninsula was almost alien from what it is today. Instead of being bone dry with endless red sand, it was a lush grassland awash in lakes and rivers and teeming with wildlife like ostriches, gazelles and hippos.

More Reporting on Human Origins

“Our study shows that the early spread of our species was aided by climate change and that humans spread into very diverse types of habitats as they moved beyond Africa,” Huw Groucutt, an archaeologist from the University of Oxford and lead author on the paper, said at a media briefing.

For more than a decade, the team had searched the vast desert for clues. They had dug up hundreds of stone tools, collected satellite imagery of thousands of paleolakes and found numerous bones belonging to wild cattle, antelopes and other animals.

“But one thing was always missing: ancient human fossils,” Dr. Groucutt said.

In 2016 their colleague Iyad Zalmout, an archaeologist with the Saudi Geological Survey and author on the paper, was prospecting in a site called Al Wusta in the Nefud Desert in the northern part of the Arabian Peninsula. He spotted something white sticking halfway out from the sediment surface. Dr. Zalmout pulled up a cylindrical bone, barely bigger than an inch, that had a socket at one end and a protrusion at the other.

“I said: ‘What could this be? It doesn’t look like any other mammal that we’ve seen here before,’” said Dr. Zalmout.

He showed the find to a colleague, who suggested it may have belonged to a primate, possibly human. Back at the camp they compared it with images of Neanderthal finger bones, but it was much longer and thinner. They concluded it was most likely the phalanx, or middle finger bone, of a Homo sapiens.

Biological anthropologists from the University of Cambridge made a three-dimensional model of the bone, which they used in a statistical analysis to determine its origin. The test compared the bone with more than 200 finger bones belonging to humans, extinct hominins like Neanderthals and the ‘hobbit,’ Homo floresiensis, and nonhuman primates like gorillas and chimpanzees.

“These studies very strongly demonstrated that this finger bone belongs to a member of our species, Homo sapiens,” Dr. Groucutt said.

The team suspects that the bone came from a middle finger, though they aren’t sure if it was from the right or left hand. They also ruled out the possibility of extracting ancient DNA from the specimen because the arid environment most likely destroyed any genetic material, they said.

To determine how old the bone was, the team sent it to Rainer Grün, a dating specialist at Griffith University in Australia, who had previously helped date a 180,000-year-old jawbone from an Israeli cave.

Using a laser, he and his colleagues drilled seven microscopic holes into the bone. When the bone was buried, it absorbed uranium, which can be measured and provide a minimum age estimate. The fossil came back as being about 88,000 years old. The team also dated a hippopotamus tooth, stone tools and sediments, which provided similar date ranges of about 85,000 to 90,000 years.

Dating sites of ancient human occupation can be controversial because often they rely only on measurements of sediments where human remains were found and not the remains themselves.

“But here we’ve dated both the deposits and the fossil finger bone directly,” Dr. Petraglia said. “And so we think we have a very, very strong case to make in terms of the dating of this site.”

So far, the finger bone from Al Wusta is the oldest Homo sapiens fossil found outside of Africa and the Levant that has been directly dated.

Dr. María Martinón-Torres, the director of the National Research Center on Human Evolution in Spain said the team’s dating techniques were solid.

“Homo sapiens fossils with reliable dating and context around this period, outside Africa, are very scarce,” she said. “This is the type of solid evidence we need to challenge some models that were close to becoming a dogma rather than a scientific hypothesis, like the recent ‘Out of Africa’ model.”

For Dr. Petraglia, the finding opens up an opportunity for further exploration of Saudi Arabia’s ancient past. Because the country has historically closed itself off from foreign researchers, its role in modern humans’ early migration story has been largely underrepresented.

Ahmad Bahameem, a member of the Saudi Geological Survey said he was optimistic about future Homo sapiens discoveries from the Arabian Peninsula.

“This fossil is just a piece of a whole skeleton, like a drop of rain,” Mr. Bahameem said. But, he added, “the rain is coming.”"
"Review: For the Martha Graham Company, Opposites Attract","To its credit, the 92-year-old Martha Graham Dance Company is not beholden to its founder’s style. In recent years, as the company has broadened its repertory to include non-Graham works — one approach to staying vital — it has entertained the notion that opposites attract. The dry restraint favored by someone like Annie-B Parson couldn’t be further from Graham’s effusive theatricality, yet the troupe thrived in Ms. Parson’s “The Snow Falls in the Winter” in 2015. One of the most successful “Lamentation Variations” (reinventions of Graham’s 1930 “Lamentation”) was a 2012 iteration by Yvonne Rainer, who, as a founder of the 1960s collective Judson Dance Theater, rejected much of what Graham and her cohort championed.

For its current City Center season, which opened on Wednesday, the company seemed poised to offer a similar study in contrasts, presenting a newly expanded version of Lucinda Childs’s “Histoire” alongside Graham’s 1958 “Embattled Garden” and the company premiere of Lar Lubovitch’s “The Legend of Ten” (2010). A titan of postmodern dance, Ms. Childs, also a founding member of Judson, is well known for her crystalline minimalism and mathematical imagination, which arranges dance steps like fractals. She first created “Histoire” as a duet for the Graham company in 1999, to music by the Polish composer Krzysztof Knittel. Though still anchored by that duet, it now features eight dancers and additional music by Astor Piazzolla.

What’s surprising about “Histoire” is not how different it is from Graham but how alike. More than pushing the company into unfamiliar terrain, it shows a side of Ms. Childs that we rarely see, still severe but more emotionally driven. While there’s no explicit story here, there is a definite concern with human relationships; these are not just people as forms in space, but also people with feelings for one another.

While this form-feeling tension is interesting to think about, “Histoire” enchants only fleetingly, mostly as it builds momentum toward the end, whisked along by the tango-inflected music. By that point the valiant central pair — Laurel Dalley Smith and Ari Mayzick — have joined with the work’s three other couples in an onrush of turns, lifts and near-collisions that break through the stiffness of earlier sections. When the couples part, with the men and women exiting in opposite directions, they look past each other as if, for all they’ve been through, they haven’t quite connected.

In a sense “The Legend of Ten,” to Brahms’s Quintet in F minor, picked up where “Histoire” left off, with a breathy sweep that the 10 dancers maintained throughout — but only after Mr. Lubovitch, whose own troupe turns 50 this year, received the 2018 Martha Graham Award for Lasting Impact to the Field of Dance. (The award, founded by Graham, was discontinued after her death in 1991 and reinstated this year.) “Legend” demonstrates the kind of playful energy and inventive mind needed to sustain a modern dance career for five decades.

The dancers seemed to still be settling into Mr. Lubovitch’s fluid movement, which has a downward pull more buoyant than Graham’s. In terms of technique, they were more in their element in “Embattled Garden,” which opened the program. Yet no matter how stunningly performed, and even with the refreshing addition of live music, this foray into the Garden of Eden with a cast of four and a vibrant Isamu Noguchi set feels stuck in a different time. The awkwardly paced effort to contextualize the work — a video and slideshow juxtaposing old and new versions, difficult to see under the still-dimming house lights — didn’t make it feel any more alive. The Graham repertory on other programs this season — like “Panorama” and “Chronicle,” two pieces with more staying power — may fare better."
Opinion | German Conservatism Is Making a Comeback,"Traditionally, the anchor of German conservatism in the Bundestag has been the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democrats. In the run-up to this year’s state elections in Bavaria, it too has been hardening its position on immigration and integration, explicitly to block the far-right Alternative for Germany party, known by its German abbreviation AfD.

“If we talk and act in a manner that broad groups have painfully missed recently, we can render the AfD obsolete,” said Alexander Dobrindt, who heads the Christian Social Union’s caucus at the Bundestag.

In January, Mr. Dobrindt published his own conservative manifesto in the German newspaper Die Welt. The majority in Germany, he writes, thinks and feels “bürgerlich” — a term often rendered in English as “civic,” but in German, it also encompasses a sense of tradition, orderliness and normality. According to Mr. Dobrindt, the “civic” majority is underrepresented in the public debate, which, he claims, is dominated by left-leaning opinion leaders. It is time, he writes, for a “conservative revolution.”

But what would be gained if the AfD vanishes yet populist thought seeps into mainstream politics?

On the one hand, the “new conservatives” share some of the tangible policy positions held by the AfD — a reduction in immigration, repatriation of migrants, stronger domestic security policies. These are not new conservative policies per se, and they are a part of mainstream politics. But with the traditional right embracing them so loudly in the context of a resurgent far right, there’s no question that the far right itself is gaining ground as an ideology. There’s a new radicalism in the new conservatism.

Like the AfD, the new conservatives see immigration not just as a practical problem that poses difficulties for the welfare system, integration, housing and security. Many frame it as an existential threat to Germany’s national identity, and to “the Occident” more broadly. “Existential” threats can legitimize extraordinary measures.

Many new conservatives like to think of themselves as rebels against the Merkelian status quo. They often call themselves the “silent majority,” large in number but underrepresented in the country’s news media and political institutions. It’s an old trope, and not unique to Germany, but again, context matters — and in today’s climate, it reinforces the idea that there is something fundamentally wrong with our democratic system.

The implication is that the system does not recognize the true interests of society. It also suggests that the system can no longer be changed by democratic deliberation, but that a more fundamental opposition may be needed, and a deposing of the elites allegedly manipulating the system in their favor. In brief, the new conservatism is populist."
"With New Tax Law, I.R.S. Urges Taxpayers to Review Withholdings","Sooner is better than later, he said. Since we are now three months into the year, there are fewer pay periods remaining in which to make adjustments.

Those who should make a special effort to review their withholdings, the I.R.S. said, include two-income families, people with children, people who itemized deductions in 2017 and people who had either large tax bills or large refunds in 2017.

The I.R.S. has updated its online withholding calculator to help with the review.

The calculator allows taxpayers to estimate their 2018 income tax, and compare the amount with their current tax withholding, to help them decide if they need to have more or less money withheld from their paycheck.

“It’s kind of a handy little thing,” said Cindy Hockenberry, director of tax research and government relations with the National Association of Tax Professionals. Ms. Hockenberry said she had tried the tool and found it “pretty accurate” for her situation.

People who were getting a significant refund before the tax law changes should consider whether they could end up with an even larger one if they don’t revise their paycheck withholdings, she said. The I.R.S. says the average refund last year was just over $2,800.

“That’s a good chunk of money,” Ms. Hockenberry said. Many people might prefer to reduce their tax withholdings, she said, and take home more cash in their paycheck for living expenses.

The I.R.S. advises that people with particularly complex tax situations — including those owing self-employment tax or the alternative minimum tax, or those who have capital gains and dividends — may need to consult Publication 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax, to check their withholdings instead of using the online calculator. The publication is expected to be updated in “early spring,” the I.R.S. said.

It may be wise, Mr. Walters said, for those taxpayers to consult a tax professional to make sure they are on track with proper withholdings.

Here are some questions and answers about checking your paycheck withholdings:

What documents do I need to use the I.R.S. withholding calculator?

Before you start, have handy a copy of your current pay stub and your most recent federal income tax return — ideally, your 2017 return, the I.R.S. says. That will help you answer the questions. The calculator asks questions like how often you receive paychecks, how much has been withheld in taxes already this year and whether you contribute to a 401(k) plan. (You don’t have to enter your name or other personally identifiable information to use the tool, and the I.R.S. says it doesn’t save the information entered on the calculator.)

How do I make changes to my paycheck withholding?

Fill out a new I.R.S. Form W-4, using data provided by the calculator, and give it to your payroll office or human resources department.

“You submit it to your employer, not the I.R.S.,” Ms. Hockenberry said. You filled out a W-4 form when you were hired, but you may not have given it a thought since.

To increase the amount of money withheld from your paycheck for taxes, you’ll need to reduce the number of “allowances” you claim on the form; to decrease the amount withheld, you’ll increase the allowances claimed. The I.R.S. offers additional tips on its website.

Are other online tax withholding tools available?

Some commercial preparers and tax software providers, including TurboTax and H & R Block, offer free online withholding calculators that have been updated for 2018."
"Review: Sound, or Silence? A Passionate Debate in ‘Children of a Lesser God’","That would seem like rationalization if Sarah weren’t so smart and, in a knockout professional debut performance by Lauren Ridloff, so superb at A.S.L. Her fluency and expressiveness make the English speakers around her seem, as one of them actually calls her, dumb.

Photo

Perhaps the novelty of that idea helped to make the original Broadway production of “Children of a Lesser God,” which opened in 1980, a hit. Today its dramaturgy seems creaky, even when the argument is crackling.

Naturally, the conceit of the play requires Sarah, who now works at the school as a custodian, to face a persuasive combatant in the form of her latest teacher, James. Rather less naturally, it requires her to fall in love with him.

And wouldn’t you know it: James is not only a fan of spoken English, but also a fan of his own voice. He’s glib and lordly and — giving credit to a lovely performance by Joshua Jackson — charming, too. He almost makes you forget that he’s browbeating Sarah into the denial of something she sees as a central, positive element of her personhood.

To her, as to many deaf people today, deafness is an identity, not a defect or a curse imposed by a lesser god. (The play’s title comes from Tennyson’s poem “Idylls of the King.”) And for Sarah, if not Orin (who speaks and lip-reads), sign language is the unique expression of that identity.

At least on the page, “Children of a Lesser God” seems skeptical of Sarah’s conviction, painting her refusal to speak as a form of hysteria, with abuse and cold parenting in the background. (Her mother is played, implacably, by Kecia Lewis.)

But Ms. Ridloff’s blistering performance, like Phyllis Frelich’s in the original and Marlee Matlin’s in the 1986 movie, contradicts that skepticism. We see in front of us that A.S.L. is not just a different language, but also a different way of thinking in which “veal” might be rendered as “cowbaby” and change the way you feel about it. (Alexandria Wailes is the sign language director.) Dialogue that seems banal in English — as the production’s supertitles frequently make plain — is as gorgeous and physical as sculpture when signed.

In any case, the story no longer reads, if it ever did, as simply the conflict between a smug hearing person and a defensive deaf one. Though the romance between Sarah and James is mutual, the antiquated assumptions behind it keep pushing the male-female battle into the foreground."
Opinion | Little to Cheer About,"We did not even own our uniforms. Instead we paid a $100 rental fee, refundable only if the uniform was returned in good condition. If special outfits were required for private events, we had to buy them (and weren’t reimbursed). When I left after six years, I could not take my uniform with me because it was still in good condition; it was used for two more seasons by another Ben-Gal before I could purchase it.

To supplement the low pay, I could bring in extra money by signing up for special events with fans, which came to several hundred dollars per season. But at these events, groping, sexist comments and ogling were par for the course (sometimes literally, since we often made appearances at golf courses). And while there was a security person provided for us at stadium events, at off-site events, which could draw hundreds of fans, we were on our own.

At our orientation, our captain told us to expect harassment from fans. “When a fan gets too close or gropes you,” she said, “always smile. If a guy grabs you too tightly, take his hand off you and put your arm around him instead.” We were told to be polite and courteous, and to never get angry with fans, no matter what they did.

Some male fans leered, stared at our breasts and tried to grab us when we posed for photos with them. Bar events were particularly unpleasant because the men were often inebriated. When I posed with them, they would try to do a “boob hug,” reaching their hands around, raising them slowly and trying to touch the side of my breast. I had to delicately (but never angrily) move the hand to my waist or arrange myself far enough away that they couldn’t touch me.

Fan interactions could even be punishment for breaking the rules. On the Ben-Gals, once the cheerleaders were chosen for the four corners of the field, any women who did not “make corner” (often because of their weight) were not allowed on the field for the game. Instead, they had to go to the private suites to mingle with fans, who could be rude and ungracious. One of the reasons we all worked so hard to “make corner” was to avoid having to make a suite appearance.

In the past, most cheerleaders put up with these brutal conditions, figuring that cheering was a temporary job and there was no point fighting to change it when it was meant to be a steppingstone. Those who did complain were often shunned or punished. The overriding message we received from our directors and captains was that complainers were replaceable. Some of the more vocal women would be disqualified (by the captains) from participating in paid events, as punishment for speaking out.

Fortunately, cheerleader conditions are improving. The Seattle Seahawks were the first to offer minimum wage to their cheerleaders, in 1997. Cheerleaders for the Oakland Raiders and Tampa Bay Buccaneers now get minimum wage and overtime, as do the Ben-Gals, after lawsuits and settlements. After one of my fellow cheerleaders initiated a class-action suit against the Bengals for violation of federal employment laws, we received $255,000 in back pay. My own payout was $7,500 for three years of cheering. Today a minimum-wage cheerleader can make several thousand per year, which might cover a chunk of the cost of pantyhose, hair extensions, cosmetics and gasoline that they buy with their own money.

Some football fans adore us and can’t envision the game without us. Others think we’re bad dancers and relics of a more sexist era. But one thing is indisputable: Cheerleaders bring in money. A 2003 Forbes magazine article estimated that N.F.L. teams with cheerleaders bring in $1 million in revenue per team in calendar sales, appearances, sponsorships and clothing lines. Cheerleaders also bring traffic to team websites with blogs, photos and contests. Public events and web traffic can lead to increased ticket sales for games and a higher profile for team sponsors."
Those 2-Minute Walk Breaks? They Add Up,"But improving endurance is not the same thing as improving health.

So when scientists and governmental regulators recently began planning a major update to the 2008 exercise guidelines, they decided, as part of their research, to gather the latest studies about exercise bouts and how long workouts should last in order to benefit health.

Somewhat to their surprise, they found only a few relevant, large-scale, recent studies, and most of these relied on people’s notoriously unreliable memories of how active they had been.

So, some of the scientists working on the new exercise guidelines decided that they would need to mount a major new study themselves.

They began by looking for reliable and objective data about ordinary people’s exercise habits.

They found it in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, conducted annually for decades by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It details the lifestyles and health of tens of thousands of American men and women.

Since 2002, some of the participants in N.H.A.N.E.S. have worn accelerometers to precisely track how much and when they move throughout the day.

For the new study, which was published this month in the Journal of the American Heart Association, the scientists chose data about 4,840 men and women past the age of 40 who had worn activity trackers.

Using the accelerometer readouts, the scientists determined how many minutes per day, in total, each person had spent in moderate or vigorous physical activity. They defined moderate activity as, in essence, brisk walking, and vigorous activity, which was rare, as workouts similar to jogging.

The researchers also looked at how long each session of physical activity had continued. If a single session went on for more than five minutes, it was considered to be a “bout” of exercise. If it were shorter than five minutes, it was considered to be sporadic physical activity, such as walking down the hallway or up a brief flight of stairs.

(Originally, the scientists had planned to focus on 10-minute exercise bouts, as currently recommended, but so few of the 4,840 people were active for 10 minutes at a time that the researchers lowered their definition of an exercise “bout” to five minutes.)

Finally, they crosschecked death records to determine whether and when participants died through 2011.

The scientists found that moving strongly influenced longevity. The men and women who were the least physically active, exercising moderately for fewer than 20 minutes a day, were at the highest risk of premature death.

Those who moved more often, especially if they managed about an hour in total of physical activity over the course of the day, cut their mortality risk in half, the researchers found.

And it did not matter how they accumulated those minutes. If people walked continuously for five minutes or longer, meaning in exercise bouts, they lowered their risk of dying young.

But they gained the same benefit if they walked sporadically in short but repeated spurts, as long as they moved often.

“The message is that all physical activity counts,” says Dr. William Kraus, a professor at Duke University who conducted the study with researchers from the National Cancer Institute.

“The little things that people do every day,” like walking from their cars to the office or climbing a flight of stairs, “can and do add up and affect the risk for disease and death,” he says.

Of course, this was an epidemiological study, meaning that it can show only that more physical activity is associated with a longer life, not that it directly causes people to live longer.

The study was also short, in terms of how long it followed people.

But the results, which will be considered as scientists and experts plan changes later this year to the formal exercise guidelines, are encouraging, Dr. Kraus says.

“If you can’t go for a long walk,” he says, “a few short walks are likely to be just as good for you.”"
How Syria’s Death Toll Is Lost in the Fog of War,"In seven years, the casualties of Syria’s civil war have grown from the first handful of protesters shot by government forces to hundreds of thousands of dead.

But as the war has dragged on, growing more diffuse and complex, many international monitoring groups have essentially stopped counting.

Even the United Nations, which released regular reports on the death toll during the first years of the war, gave its last estimate in 2016 — when it relied on 2014 data, in part — and said that it was virtually impossible to verify how many had died.

At that time, a United Nations official said 400,000 people had been killed.

But so many of the biggest moments of the war have happened since then. In the past two years, the government of President Bashar al-Assad, with Russia’s help, laid siege to residential areas of Aleppo, once the country’s second-largest city, and several other areas controlled by opposition groups, leveling entire neighborhoods. Last weekend, dozens of people died in a suspected chemical attack on a Damascus suburb. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the group that monitors compliance with the ban on such munitions, is sending a team of investigators to Syria on Saturday to determine whether they were used.

American-led forces have bombed the Islamic State in large patches of eastern Syria, in strikes believed to have left thousands dead. And dozens of armed groups, including fighters backed by Iran, have continued to clash, creating a humanitarian catastrophe that the world is struggling to measure."
"‘Special Units’ in Russia Were Trained in Ways of Skripal Attack, U.K. Says","In a news conference Friday afternoon, the Russian ambassador to Britain, Aleksandr V. Yakovenko, dismissed the letter and “all these allegations” surrounding the nerve agent attack as having “nothing to do with reality.”

Russia, he said, repeating a claim the Kremlin has asserted throughout the Skripal affair, eliminated all of its stockpiles of chemical weapons in 2017, and as for Novichok, “We did not produce it and didn’t store it.”

Mr. Skripal remains hospitalized nearly five weeks after he was poisoned, but his daughter, Yulia, has recovered and was moved to a secure location this week.

Mr. Sedwill’s letter also says that Britain has evidence that Russian security services have been monitoring the Skripal family. Cyberspecialists from Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Services hacked Ms. Skripal’s email in 2013, the letter says. Asked about that at his news conference, Mr. Yakovenko responded sarcastically, “Big surprise.”

The letter adds that Russian intelligence services “view at least some of its defectors as legitimate targets for assassination.”

“We therefore continue to judge that only Russia has the technical means, operational experience and motive for the attack on the Skripals, and that it is highly likely that the Russian state was responsible,” the letter says. “There is no plausible alternative explanation.”

The letter comes as British officials try to consolidate European support for united actions against Russia. The central element of Britain’s case against Russia is the unusual nerve agent used in the attack, which was developed in Soviet laboratories during the last years of the Soviet Union.

Last week, the chief executive of the Defense Science and Technology Laboratory in Porton Down, Britain’s premier chemical weapons laboratory, said its scientists could not identify “the precise source” of the chemical, though its purity indicated that it was almost certainly created by a “state actor.”

Mr. Sedwill’s letter lays out further British intelligence on Russia’s chemical weapons programs, reporting that the Novichok agents, a strain referred to in Russia as Foliant, were developed at the State Institute for Organic Chemistry and Technology at Shikhany, a small town on the Volga river, in southern Russia. It says that Russia continued to produce the agents after the breakup of the Soviet Union, but did not declare the work to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

It goes on to say that “during the 2000s,” Russia created a special unit to develop chemical weapons for use as tools in state-sponsored attacks and to “train personnel from special units in the use of these weapons.”

“This program subsequently included investigation of ways of delivering nerve agents, including by application to door handles,” it says. “Within the last decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of Novichoks under the same program.”"
"The Personal Data of 346,000 People, Hung on a Museum Wall","Last month, Robin Li, the chief executive of the search giant Baidu, set off a firestorm when he said that Chinese people were willing to trade privacy for convenience, safety and efficiency. In December, the software developer Qihoo 360 angered many internet users when a blogger discovered that the company was taking surveillance footage from restaurants and gyms in Beijing and broadcasting it without permission onto its platform.

The rising public anger is taking place amid a similar debate in the United States, over Facebook. But Beijing officials keep the volume lower because personal data is broadly available to another powerful constituency: the Chinese government. Tech companies cooperate with the police in handing over information, with few questions asked. Citizens are resigned to the fact that they are tracked by the government, and there is little pushback about the increased state of surveillance.

So six months ago, Mr. Deng started buying people’s information, using the Chinese messaging app QQ to reach sellers. He said that the data was easy to find and that he paid a total of $800 for people’s names, genders, phone numbers, online shopping records, travel itineraries, license plate numbers — at a cost at just over a tenth of a penny per person.

He said he knew he was breaking the law. He wanted to prove a point.

“Artists are not merely aesthetic creators,” Mr. Deng said. “In the very complicated state of our world today, we should also bear social responsibility.”

At his exhibition, called “346,000 Wuhan Citizens’ Secrets,” he printed the pieces of personal data on sheets of paper using a special liquid solution. The sheets were hung in neat rows and columns on a wall. Museumgoers could only see the data under a special light source, and key identifying details were redacted.

According to Mr. Deng, plainclothes police officers took him away on April 6, two days after his exhibition opened. They told him that he was being investigated for the buying of citizens’ information online and was barred from leaving Wuhan. When reached for comment, a Wuhan-based police officer from the station investigating the case said she did not know anything about it and hung up.

Under Chinese criminal law, Mr. Deng faces up to seven years in jail. But Raymond Wang, a lawyer who specializes in data security, said he believed it was unlikely that Mr. Deng would be sentenced because there were no “damaging consequences.”

Whether Mr. Deng’s exhibit will catch the attention of China’s leaders isn’t clear. But Legal Daily, an official, government-run publication, said Mr. Deng’s project showed how the existing laws on the protection of personal information were weak and enforcement was poor.

“The organizer’s purpose was to call for the protection of personal privacy, and he himself violated the law to purchase personal information,” the newspaper wrote in an opinion piece. “Due to the complexity of the plot, it will make for a lively legal lesson.”

The privacy project is just one of Mr. Deng’s many works of art touching on social issues. He has gone undercover to investigate the kidnappings of children, a major problem in China. He has also worked on a project on how people buy fake identification cards and guns.

Mr. Deng pointed out that the lack of data privacy was also a global problem.

With the help of volunteers, Mr. Deng sent about 10,000 text messages to the people whose information he used in the exhibition, inviting them to come.

One of them was not amused, according to Mr. Deng, responding back: “You’re sick.”"
"Justice Dept. Can’t Tie Police Funding to Help on Immigration, Judge Rules","The ruling handed down Wednesday came in one of several lawsuits that state and city officials in California have filed against the federal government arguing that it has overreached in trying to force local officers to help with immigration enforcement.



“The Trump administration cannot manipulate federal grant fund requirements to pressure states, counties or municipalities to enforce federal immigration laws,” Xavier Becerra, California’s attorney general, said last year when the state filed a lawsuit against the administration for denying funding to so-called sanctuary cities.

Last month, a federal district judge declined to issue a preliminary injunction against the federal government in that case, saying that the courts in other parts of the country had reached different conclusions and that “issues in this case will benefit from further development.”

After that ruling, the Trump administration filed its own lawsuit against California over its own “sanctuary state” law, which prevents the police in many cases from holding people at the request of federal immigration agents, and limits the sharing of information about the release of some county jail inmates who are in the country illegally. In its suit, the federal government argues that the law makes it impossible for immigration officers to do their jobs. A hearing in the case is scheduled for late June.

Los Angeles has for years received millions of dollars under the federal Community Oriented Policing Services program, which is meant to promote community policing. The city police department has used the money for its Community Safety Partnership, which allows police officers to spend intensive time in neighborhoods, leading mentoring programs or coaching sports teams. The police say the program in the neighborhood of Watts has helped bring about a 50 percent reduction in violent crime and arrests.

In 2016, the city used the roughly $3 million it received to hire about 25 officers. City officials asked for the same amount of money in 2017, hoping to use it to hire more officers in a South Los Angeles neighborhood where violence had spiked.

But police departments around the country seeking a share of the $98 million pool of grant money last year were asked to demonstrate that they have a policy of alerting immigration agents before releasing inmates and giving immigration agents access to jails in order to conduct inmate interviews and review files. Departments were also asked to give federal authorities 48-hours notice before the release of any immigrants.

The Los Angeles Police Deparment did not do so, and was awarded no money. The Justice Department said the vast majority of those departments that received grants had signaled a “willingness to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.”

The city’s lawsuit argued that local governments had “an untenable choice: Commit to participating in federal civil immigration investigation and enforcement efforts, or sacrifice funds for public safety and community policing.”

In the ruling, Judge Real said that the funding rules violated the notion of separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution and improperly tried to force local police officers to take on immigration enforcement, which legally is the responsibility of the federal government. The department’s action “upset the constitutional balance between state and federal power by requiring state and local law enforcement to partner with federal authorities,” he wrote. He added that Congress, not the executive branch, has the authority to control government spending.

Several other cities, including Philadelphia and Chicago, have also filed lawsuits against the administration’s attempt to tie federal funding to immigration enforcement, arguing that the government is overstepping its authority by creating new rules on grants without approval from Congress.

Local officials have also argued that forcing local police officers to cooperate on immigration enforcement could impair their ability to win cooperation from immigrants, who may fear being at risk of deportation by speaking to local law enforcement officers. Placing immigration enforcement requirements on grants meant to improve community policing, Mr. Feuer said, is “ironic — and at worst, very dangerous.”"
Stoneman Douglas Teacher Arrested After Forgetting Loaded Gun at Beach,"By the time Mr. Simpson realized it was missing and returned to the restroom, at the Deerfield Beach Pier, a homeless man who was drunk had picked it up and fired a bullet into a wall.

Mr. Simpson, 43, grabbed the gun from the man. The deputies who responded to the scene arrested the teacher, and he was booked into the county jail on a second-degree misdemeanor charge, which can carry a maximum 60-day jail sentence.

Mr. Simpson, who was released after posting $250 bond, did not respond to an email seeking comment.

In an interview about the episode, Mr. Simpson told Local 10, the ABC station in Miami, that he did not believe he had violated Broward County Public Schools policy. A schools spokeswoman said on Friday that the district had not yet decided whether to take any action against Mr. Simpson.

While Mr. Trump’s call for arming schoolteachers has gained little momentum across the country, Gov. Rick Scott of Florida recently signed gun control measures that included a controversial provision: $67 million to create a school “marshal” program. The program would allow districts to arm and train some school employees, including librarians and counselors, but not full-time classroom teachers.

School officials and students in Broward County did not want the program, which was named after Aaron Feis, a coach who died in the massacre. This week, school board members there voted not to participate and encouraged the state to redirect the $67 million to pay for additional school resource officers.

Some critics of the president’s plan have pointed to recent cases that they say highlight the dangers of arming teachers. Last month, a teacher in Seaside, Calif., accidentally fired a handgun at school when he was showing it to students during an advanced public safety class. Three students suffered minor injuries, and the teacher resigned this week.

Two weeks after the Parkland shooting, a Georgia high school teacher was arrested after he barricaded himself in his classroom and fired through a window, the authorities said. A student was injured when she tried to run away."
California Rescuers Find Items Belonging to Missing Family,"In the latest case, the Thottapilly family had taken a road trip from their home in Santa Clarita, Calif., to Oregon for spring break. On their return on April 5, they spoke of plans to stop and visit relatives in San Jose the following day, the San Jose Police Department said in a statement.

But they never made it, and it was the last anyone heard from them, the police said.

On April 8, the relatives in San Jose contacted the police department and officially reported the family missing, telling the authorities that the family had been traveling from Portland.

Anxious acquaintances and relatives shared information online about the Thottapilly family, their smiling faces beaming out from missing persons posters. India’s minister of external affairs, Sushma Swaraj, said on Wednesday that she had been in touch with her country’s consulate in San Francisco after Mr. Thottapilly’s father, who lives in Gujarat, a state in western India, asked for her help.

Investigators began to examine the possibility that the disappearance might be linked to a report that the highway patrol received on April 6 of a vehicle plummeting into the Eel River from U.S. 101, a north-south highway that runs through Washington State, Oregon and California.

But the river had turned swollen and fast after days of stormy weather, and at first the rescuers were unable to search it. The California Highway Patrol said this week that a submerged vehicle had been spotted but then lost in the current.

Fast waters meant a slow-moving search. A piece of burgundy plastic, believed to be part of a side window, surfaced earlier this week, but the authorities were hesitant about saying whether it belonged to the family’s Honda Pilot of the same color.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, rescue teams pressed on with a search along the river bank, the highway patrol’s local branch in Garberville said. They used an underwater probe to see if the vehicle or anything metallic could be located. They deployed boats, or used flotation devices to explore under overhanging trees or tight areas not accessible by boat.

The Humboldt County Sheriff’s Office also assisted, using a sonar system.

They made headway over about 12 miles of river bank during two days of searching.

Finally, late on Thursday, the highway patrol said there had been no sign of the missing people, but the recovered objects — the vehicle parts and personal items — were confirmed by family members as belonging to the Thottapillys. “These items were of a personal nature and will not be described further at this time,” the highway patrol said."
"After Cambridge Analytica, Privacy Experts Get to Say ‘I Told You So’","The outcry over data privacy has been so strong that it pushed Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, into testifying on Capitol Hill this week over the company’s failures to protect users’ information. Protesters rallied outside the Capitol during his testimony. Someone even arrived at a hearing dressed as a Russian troll.

In their own lives, privacy experts are now fielding a spike in calls from their relatives asking them for advice about protecting their personal data. Engineers are discussing new privacy projects with them. Even teenagers are paying attention to what they have to say.

For many developers, this is the right time to push ahead with testing more privacy solutions, including more advanced advertising blockers; peer-to-peer browsers that decentralize the internet; new encryption techniques; and data unions that let users pool their data and sell it themselves. Others want to treat tech giants more as information fiduciaries, which have a legal responsibility to protect user data.

And for the first time, many privacy experts think internet users will be more willing to put up with a little more inconvenience in return for a lot more privacy.

“This is the first blink of awakening of the world to a danger that’s been present for a long time, which is that we are exposed,” Mr. Searls said. “Cambridge Analytica is old, old news to privacy folks.”

John Scott-Railton, who researches digital rights and privacy at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, said he recently thought back to all the PowerPoint presentations and papers he had given and seen that cautioned about how third parties might access and abuse user data.

“It didn’t stick until now,” he said. “Now it’s changed, or at least people nod along when we talk about it.”

Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, recalled the organization’s years of efforts to get Facebook to monitor how third parties were using data. Yet few paid attention at the time, even though the group specifically called out Facebook’s quizzes in 2009. (Cambridge Analytica used a third-party quiz app from an independent researcher to harvest Facebook users’ data.)

The social network has said it will investigate many third-party apps that have had access to large amounts of users information. Nonetheless, the A.C.L.U. is pushing for users to have tighter control over what Facebook apps can do and arguing that Facebook ought to audit its developers. The organization also believes that more privacy protections should be enshrined in law.

“We’re having the conversation now that we should have had over a decade ago,” Ms. Singh Guliani said.

Some privacy experts are prepared for disappointment. There have been privacy scandals before that did not lead to sea changes. For example, Google once collected private Wi-Fi information as it was building out Google Maps. The ensuing outrage did not have a lasting effect on the Silicon Valley company’s vast data collection effort.

But this Facebook scandal seems to be enduring even in the new frenetic news cycle.

“This has kept the national attention for what: three or four weeks now?” said Allie Bohm, policy counsel at Public Knowledge, a nonprofit in Washington that promotes an open internet. “It really feels like, hey, we could get some stuff done.”

One reason it has always been hard to get consumers interested in security and privacy is that the harms were vague and hard to understand. With Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, the harms are identifiable and frightening, said Ashkan Soltani, an independent researcher specializing in privacy and a former chief technologist of the Federal Trade Commission.

“Much like a car accident, the harms on social media are low-probablility events with extremely variable outcomes,” he said. “ ‘So what if my boss saw me doing a keg stand?’ But all of a sudden the ‘so what if’ becomes more serious — ‘I get denied insurance or my information is used by a nation state actor to manipulate me.’ ”

Cambridge Analytica’s work, which included using Facebook data to build psychological profiles of voters, tapped into an anxiety many Americans already had over the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.

“This one stuck because it was Trump, and we’re looking for someone to blame,” said Bruce Schneier, a cryptographer who runs the Schneier on Security blog and wrote “Data and Goliath: The Hidden Battles to Collect Your Data and Control Your World.” “If Hellmann’s mayonnaise did this, we’d be impressed.”

Privacy experts said this shift in public opinion was what they had been waiting for, because it is the only way to bring about change. Facebook will not willingly change its policies without pressure from shareholders or regulators, they added.

Historically, public opinion is “the crucible” for era-defining industry change, said Shoshana Zuboff, a professor at Harvard Business School and the author of a forthcoming book about tech platforms and power.

“If you go back to the rapaciousness and lawlessness of Gilded Age capitalism, it was the slow burn of public opinion that gradually gathered force and ultimately became the driving force that provided cover for dramatic new legislative and regulatory efforts,” she said. “Public opinion gave the Gilded Age a beginning, a middle and an end.”

For Rohit Ghai, president of the cybersecurity firm RSA, whose SecurID technology has become an industry standard for companies protecting access to their internal systems, the change is evident even inside his home in San Jose, Calif.

He previously tried to talk to his 13-year-old daughter about data privacy and social media — even providing examples of how much the tech companies know about people and what they can do with that information. She shrugged him off.

Then the Cambridge Analytica revelations happened. For once, Mr. Ghai said, his teenager came to talk to him.

“She just asked me about Mark Zuckerberg,” he said. “That’s a sign.”"
UNICEF: Boko Haram has kidnapped more than 1000 children in Nigeria,"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Terror group Boko Haram has kidnapped more than 1,000 children in Nigeria since 2013, UNICEF said Friday.

The statement came as Nigeria prepares to make the four-year anniversary of the Chibok abductions on April 14, 2014.

""Since 2013, more than 1000 children have been abducted by Boko Haram in northeastern Nigeria, including 276 girls taken from their secondary school in the town of Chibok in 2014,"" the statement said.

The Chibok abduction sparked global outrage and reignited the fight against the ISIS-aligned terrorist group.

Some of the girls were finally freed three years later, following negotiation talks between the Nigerian government and Boko Haram.

But more than 100 of them remain in captivity.

'A grave violation'

The UN agency appealed for an end to attacks on schools and ""all grave violations of children's rights,"" in the northeast of the country.

Children, particularly young girls, are vulnerable to attacks by the militant group and the agency said they have been ""consistently targeted and exposed to brutal violence in their homes, schools and public places.""

""These repeated attacks against children in schools are unconscionable. Children have the right to education and protection, and the classroom must be a place where they are safe from harm, UNICEF representative in Nigeria,"" Mohammed Malick Fall said in the statement.

Four years on more than 100 of the Chibok girls are still missing.

Hopeful parents

Yana Galang, whose daughter Rifkatu is still missing, says she is hopeful her daughter will come back.

Every year on the anniversary of their daughters' disappearance, the parents gather in Chibok to pray for their safe return.

And this year will be no different.

""I know in my heart that Rifkatu will come back. I have not given up hope,"" she says.

Last year, Boko Haram released a video where they showed veiled girls they claimed were Chibok girls saying they would never return.

One of the alleged Chibok students said: ""We are the Chibok girls that you cry for us to return to you. By the grace of Allah, we will not return to you.

The Bring Back Our Girls group has long campaigned for the return of the Chibok girls through protest marches, rallies and sit-ins.

They have clashed repeatedly with the Jonathan and Buhari administrations as they put them over pressure over the return of the schoolgirls.

In less than a DAY it would be FOUR YEARS since #ChibokGirlsTragedy of April 14, 2014.

In less than 15 days it would be 4 YEARS since that first protest MARCH of #BringBackOurGirls, DAILY SIT OUTS & special marches for their RESCUE.

107 are BACK.

112 ARE NOT.

.@MBuhari #BBOG!! pic.twitter.com/JJJfvK3JjJ — Oby Ezekwesili (@obyezeks) April 13, 2018

This year, this group is marking the anniversary on Saturday with a march in Lagos and a lecture in Nigeria's capital Abuja.

The Dapchi kidnapping

Schools have been long been a focus of attack for Boko Haram who recently kidnapped 110 schoolgirls from Dapchi, Yobe State, northeast Nigeria.

All of the girls have now been reunited with their families after they were freed by Boko Haram.

However, one of them Leah Sharibu remains in captivity because she allegedly refused to renounce her Christian faith.

Since the conflict started nearly nine years ago, around 2,295 teachers have been killed and more than 1400 schools destroyed, UNICEF said.

Osai Ojigho Director Amnesty International Nigeria joined in the voices calling for the Nigerian government to do more to keep schools safe in the country.

""The time is long overdue for the government to deliver meaningful action on behalf for all these victims of Boko Haram's crimes. This starts by doing more to secure the release of the hundreds still being held, including the remaining Chibok girls and Leah Sharibu, the only Dapchi girl still in captivity.""

Amnesty also called for better record keeping of missing and displaced, especially in IDP camps.

""Far more support must also be provided for past victims,"" Ojigbo said.

""For the families of those still missing, the government should open a register for abducted people, ensuring that the tens of thousands of people living in displacement camps get the opportunity to register their loved ones."""
Gunmen kill 26 in Nigeria's Zamfara state,"Story highlights Armed robbery has been a long-running problem in Zamfara's gold mining communities

Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Twenty six people, including 16 illegal gold miners, were killed after gunmen attacked several villages in northwest Nigerian state of Zamfara, state police said Friday.

Armed bandits stormed a mining site in a remote village late Wednesday shooting at residents, Mohammed Shehu, a spokesman for the Kaduna State police told CNN.

""They ambushed 16 illegal gold miners and shot at them. Four people who heard the gunshots and ran to the site to assist were killed. They attacked another village and killed six people,"" Shehu said.

Dozens of armed men stormed Kuru Kuru village Wednesday evening, demanding gold from miners before opening fire, one resident said.

""They came when the miners were coming from the forest in the evening and started shooting asking for gold. They shot at everyone in sight as they escaped,"" Amisu Ahiru told CNN.

Winnie Mandela: Tributes paid at South Africa memorial service,"Soweto, South Africa (CNN) Thousands of mourners gathered Wednesday in South Africa for a public memorial service for Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, the anti-apartheid campaigner and former wife of the late President Nelson Mandela .

The memorial in Soweto comes ahead of a funeral service to be held on Saturday.

Madikizela-Mandela died in a Johannesburg hospital on April 2 at the age of 81, after what her family said was a long illness. She was known as the ""Mother of the Nation"" because of her struggle against white minority rule in South Africa.

South African students sing and dance with other mourners at the memorial service.

Singing echoed round the Orlando Stadium in Soweto township as the mourners, some dancing as they sang, remembered Madikizela-Mandela's life in a lengthy service. Many were clad in the black, green and gold of the ruling African National Congress political party, some in T-shirts with an image of Madikizela-Mandela.

Among the many to pay tribute were Deputy President David Mabuza, South African Energy Minister Jeff Radebe and Rita Ndzanga, a close family friend and fellow anti-apartheid activist.

Mabuza recalled Madikizela-Mandela as a ""unifier and a visionary of note"" who had championed reconciliation, and said her lasting monument would be ""for all South Africans to unite behind the vision of a united, non-racial, non-sexist, just and prosperous society.""

He also recognized the example she had been to many women. ""You taught young women across the nation that they are just as capable, if not more capable, of standing shoulder to shoulder with men and being totally unapologetic about it,"" Mabuza said. ""Till death, you knew who your enemy was: racial domination, class exploitation, gender oppression.""

A man holds up a frame showing newspaper clippings of Madikizela-Mandela.

Madikizela-Mandela's grandson, Bambatha Mandela, said it was a time for mourning but also a time to celebrate the life of an ""extraordinary woman"" who was ""a mother, a soldier, an icon.""

He paid tribute to her efforts in support of his grandfather and criticized those who questioned her legacy. ""Behind every great man is a greater woman. Umama was the embodiment of that quote,"" he said, using a local word for mother.

Bambatha Mandela added that his grandmother had never moved away from Soweto, as many others had, because she wanted to live among the people for whom she had fought.

Several of Madikizela-Mandela's great-grandchildren also spoke in remembrance of her. ""Big mummy, we all love you,"" said one.

""Fellow South Africans, we have lost a mother, we have lost a friend,"" said Madikizela-Mandela's personal assistant, Zodwa Zwane.

Madikizela-Mandela was married to Nelson Mandela for 38 years, including the 27 years he was imprisoned on an island near Cape Town.

Nelson and Winnie Mandela raise fists to supporters after his release from jail in February 1990.

A longtime stalwart of the ANC, she was a member of South Africa's parliament at the time of her death.

ANC Deputy Secretary General Jessie Duarte said Madikizela-Mandela had loved the party and that her life's work of ""returning the land to the people"" must continue. ""This is our hero, this is our heroine, we know her worth -- she gave everything to us,"" Duarte said.

One of the last official visits the anti-apartheid activist received was from current South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who went with her to Soweto township last month to encourage people to register to vote in next year's presidential election.

Following her death, Ramaphosa praised Madikizela-Mandela as ""an advocate for the dispossessed and the marginalized"" and ""a voice for the voiceless.""

""Even at the darkest moments of our struggle for liberation, Mam' Winnie was an abiding symbol of the desire of our people to be free,"" Ramaphosa said in a statement. ""In the midst of repression, she was a voice of defiance and resistance. In the face of exploitation, she was a champion of justice and equality.""

Born in 1936 in what is now known as Eastern Cape province, Nomzamo Winifred Madikizela was the daughter of a history teacher.

As a 22-year-old social worker, she married Nelson Mandela in 1958, and stood by him in the years following his 1964 conviction and life imprisonment for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government.

Madikizela-Mandela led an international campaign calling for his release.

Outside Africa, Madikizela-Mandela was known largely because of her ex-husband, but in South Africa she was the mouthpiece and face of the bitter struggle against the racist regime.

Although Madikizela-Mandela helped usher in a new, more equitable South African political system during her lifetime, she was also entangled in a number of scandals over the years."

"Fallen officer was ‘Tom Brady’ of department, Yarmouth police chief says","YARMOUTH, MA (WHDH) – A Somerville man accused of shooting and killing a beloved Yarmouth police officer Thursday has been ordered held without bail.

RELATED: ‘We feel helpless’: Community mourns K-9 officer’s tragic death

Thomas Latanowich, 29, who prosecutors said has more than 100 criminal charges on his record, pleaded not guilty Friday in the First District Court of Barnstable. He is facing a murder charge in connection with the shooting death of 32-year-old canine officer Sean Gannon.

Dozens of police officers filled the benches of the courtroom as Latanowich was arraigned.

“Sean was a remarkable young man. We refer to him as the Tom Brady of the Yarmouth Police Department,” Chief Frank Frederickson said following the arraignment.

Prosecutors say Gannon was shot in the head while he and other officers attempted to serve a probation warrant on Blueberry Lane. He was rushed by ambulance to Cape Cod Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.

Sources have told 7News that Latanowich was hiding in a closet in the home’s attic before he shot Gannon in the head.

Gannon’s K-9 partner, Nero, was also shot and was taken to a veterinary clinic in Dennis to be treated.

“He died doing what he loved to do, and that is working with his dog, helping his brother officers and protecting all of you,” Frederickson said of Gannon.

Latanowich, who has been labeled a “career criminal,” has more than 100 arrests for violent crimes that date back more than a decade. The Massachusetts Probation Service says Latanowich’s conditions of probation included random drug screens and a mental health evaluation, among other things.

An official told 7News that Latanowich was not home for a probation visit on April 4 and that he failed to appear for a drug test on April 5. A warrant was issued for his arrest on April 6.

Latanowich had been sentenced on July 26, 2010, to 4-5 years in prison for assault with a dangerous weapon. He has also been charged with heroin possession, witness intimidation and receiving stolen property, among other things. He was released on parole in Nov. 2013, returned to custody in June 2014 for violating parole and then released days later.

Latanowich’s five-year probation period was slated to end on Nov. 1, 2018.

Cape and Islands District Attorney Michael O’Keefe said Latanowich had a drug conviction overturned as a result of the Annie Dookhan scandal.

Latanowich is due back in court in June. O’Keefe says he plans to bring the case in front of a grand jury. A murder indictment is expected.

The Yarmout Police Foundation is collecting donations to support Gannon’s family. A candlelight vigil has been planned for Saturday night to honor Gannon.

The shooting remains under investigation.

Memorial to fallen K-9 officer grows outside Yarmouth police station,"YARMOUTH, Mass. (WHDH) — Members of the community came and went from the Yarmouth Police Department Friday, leaving flowers and paying their respects to a K-9 officer killed in the line of duty on Thursday.

K-9 Officer Sean Gannon, 32, was shot and killed while serving a probation warrant at a home on Blueberry Lane in Marstons Mills. His K-9 partner, Nero, was also shot and treated at an animal hospital in Dennis.

Gannon’s cruiser was parked outside the police station and has since become a memorial, covered in black bunting with a memorial wreath and American flags placed nearby. Residents have visited throughout the day on Friday to place flowers on his cruiser.

“We hope that his family gains some measure of comfort knowing the whole town is grieving with them,” said Dianna Braginton-Smith.

Among those visiting the police station to remember Gannon was Cheryl Siels, who said the officer helped train her German Shepherd. Siels brought her dog with her to the station.

“He was a great friend, great guy. One of a kind,” said Siels.

Jean Kenneally said Gannon was the officer who tended to her son when he had a medical problem.

“Officer Gannon was there with him, stayed with him the entire time, never left his side, comforted him. He was great with people,” said Kenneally.

Members of the fire department helped hang up bunting on the police station. Local restaurants dropped off so much food at the station that the department is now requesting people donate to the fund helping Gannon’s family instead of bringing more food.

The man charged in Gannon’s murder was ordered held without bail on Friday.

Former transit officer accused of North Station indecent assaults,"BOSTON (WHDH) - A former transit officer accused of indecently assaulting two women at North Station while on duty last month pleaded not guilty at his arraignment Friday.

James Floyd, 60, of Winthrop, was arrested Friday morning and arraigned in Boston Municipal Court on charges including indecent assault and battery, assault with a dangerous weapon, and intimidation of a witness, a Suffolk District Attorney spokesman said.

Prosecutors say Floyd indecently assaulted two women within a 17-minute span while working a detail at North Station March 29. Floyd is also accused of offering one the victims a knife and challenging her to stab him with it, and opening a collapsible metal baton and staring at the woman in a threatening manner.

After the assaults were reported, transit police officials relieved him of duty. He later resigned.

“There is no excuse for sexual assault and absolutely no room in law enforcement for the behavior alleged in these complaints,” Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said in a statement. “I want to thank Transit Police for taking this investigation so seriously from its earliest stages, and I want to remind every victim and survivor that our office will always be a safe, respectful, and confidential resource for anyone who wants to disclose sexual assault.”

Floyd was ordered released on his own recognizance on the condition that he stay away from the alleged victims and witnesses. He is due back in court June 21.

This is a developing news story, 7News will post additional information as it becomes available.

"1 arrested, 2 wanted after alleged kidnapping leads to police pursuit from Lawrence to Lowell","ANDOVER, MA (WHDH) - Authorities are still searching for two people connected to an armed kidnapping that led to a police pursuit from Lawrence to Lowell, officials said.

Lawrence police and state troopers responded about 11:20 p.m. Thursday to a reported kidnapping during which the suspects showed weapons.

Troopers soon located a gray Dodge Caravan believed to be connected to the kidnapping on Granada Way in Andover and located the victim, but the suspects fled on foot. A search by troopers, K-9 units, and the state police air wing unit ensued.

Around 12:22 a.m., troopers began pursuing a black Chrysler 300 also believed to be related to the alleged kidnapping after spotting the car on Route 110 in Lawrence. The pursuit ended on Avon Street in Lowell, where three suspects bailed out of the car, police said.

Troopers captured one of the suspects and booked him at the state police barracks in Andover. Police said they also recovered a weapon.

Authorities identified the suspect as Joel Aguilar, 37, of Lowell. He is slated to be arraigned Friday on charges of assault and battery on an officer, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct.

Officers are still looking for the other two male suspects who fled the scene.

This investigation is ongoing. Stay with 7News for updates.

"Comey compares Trump to mob boss, Trump cries ‘slime ball’","WASHINGTON (AP) — Firing back at a sharply critical book by former FBI director James Comey, President Donald Trump blasted him Friday as an “untruthful slime ball,” saying, “It was my great honor to fire James Comey!”

Trump reacted on Twitter early Friday, the day after the emergence of details from Comey’s memoir, which says Trump is “untethered to truth,” and describes him as fixated in the early days of his presidency on having the FBI debunk salacious rumors he said were untrue but that could distress his wife.

The book, “A Higher Loyalty,” is to be released next week. The Associated Press purchased a copy this week.

In the book, Comey compares Trump to a mafia don and calls his leadership of the country “ego driven and about personal loyalty.”

Comey also reveals new details about his interactions with Trump and his own decision-making in handling the Hillary Clinton email investigation before the 2016 election. He casts Trump as a mobster-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics and tried to pressure him personally regarding his investigation into Russian election interference.

The book adheres closely to Comey’s public testimony and written statements about his contacts with Trump and his growing concern about Trump’s integrity. It also includes strikingly personal jabs at Trump that appear sure to irritate the president.

The 6-foot-8 Comey describes Trump as shorter than he expected with a “too long” tie and “bright white half-moons” under his eyes that he suggests came from tanning goggles. He also says he made a conscious effort to check the president’s hand size, saying it was “smaller than mine but did not seem unusually so.”

“Donald Trump’s presidency threatens much of what is good in this nation,” Comey writes, calling the administration a “forest fire” that can’t be contained by ethical leaders within the government.

On a more-personal level, Comey describes Trump repeatedly asking him to consider investigating an allegation involving Trump and Russian prostitutes urinating on a bed in a Moscow hotel, in order to prove it was a lie. Trump has strongly denied the allegation, and Comey says that it appeared the president wanted it investigated to reassure his wife, Melania Trump.

Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a scramble at the Justice Department that led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller’s probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, which the president denies.

Trump has assailed Comey as a “showboat” and a “liar.” Top White House aides also criticized the fired FBI director on Friday. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders questioned Comey’s credibility in a tweet and White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said Comey took “unnecessary, immature pot shots.”

Comey’s account lands at a particularly sensitive moment for Trump and the White House. Officials there describe the president as enraged over a recent FBI raid of his personal lawyer’s home and office, raising the prospect that he could fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller, or try to shut down the probe on his own. The Republican National Committee is poised to lead the pushback effort against Comey by launching a website and supplying surrogates with talking points that question his credibility.

Trump has said he fired Comey because of his handling of the FBI’s investigation into Clinton’s email practices. Trump used the investigation as a cudgel in the campaign and repeatedly said Clinton should be jailed for using a personal email system while serving as secretary of state. Democrats, on the other hand, have accused Comey of politicizing the investigation, and Clinton herself has said it hurt her election prospects.

Comey writes that he regrets his approach and some of the wording he used in his July 2016 press conference in which he announced the decision not to prosecute Clinton. But he says he believes he did the right thing by going before the cameras and making his statement, noting that the Justice Department had done so in other high profile cases.

Every person on the investigative team, Comey writes, found that there was no prosecutable case against Clinton and that the FBI didn’t find that she lied under its questioning.

He also reveals new details about how the government had unverified classified information that he believes could have been used to cast doubt on Attorney General Loretta Lynch’s independence in the Clinton probe. While Comey does not outline the details of the information — and says he didn’t see indications of Lynch inappropriately influencing the investigation — he says it worried him that the material could be used to attack the integrity of the probe and the FBI’s independence.

Comey’s book will be heavily scrutinized by the president’s legal team looking for any inconsistencies between it and his public testimony, under oath, before Congress. They will be looking to impeach Comey’s credibility as a key witness in Mueller’s obstruction investigation, which the president has cast as a political motivated witch hunt.

The former FBI director provides new details of his firing. He writes that then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly — now Trump’s chief of staff — offered to quit out of disgust at how Comey was dismissed. Kelly has been increasingly marginalized in the White House and the president has mused to confidants about firing him.

Comey also writes extensively about his first meeting with Trump after the election, a briefing in January 2017 at Trump Tower in New York City. Others in the meeting included Vice President Mike Pence, Trump’s first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, Michael Flynn, who would become national security adviser, and incoming press secretary, Sean Spicer. Comey was also joined by NSA Director Mike Rogers, CIA Director John Brennan and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.

After Clapper briefed the team on the intelligence community’s findings of Russian election interference, Comey writes, he was taken aback by what the Trump team didn’t ask.

“They were about to lead a country that had been attacked by a foreign adversary, yet they had no questions about what the future Russian threat might be,” Comey writes. Instead, he writes, they launched into a strategy session about how to “spin what we’d just told them” for the public.

Comey says he had flashbacks to his time investigating the Italian Mafia as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, thinking that Trump “was trying to make us all part of the same family.”

“For my entire career, intelligence was a thing of mine and political spin a thing of yours. Team Trump wanted to change that,” he writes.

Trump still mulling Syria strike; Russia assails gas photos,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Russia and Britain exchanged sharp accusations Friday over the suspected poison gas attack in Syria, and the U.S. Navy was moving an additional Tomahawk missile-armed ship within striking range as President Donald Trump and his national security aides mulled the scope and timing of an expected military assault.

Trump’s U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley, said the president had not yet made a final decision, two days after he tweeted that Russia should “get ready” because a missile attack “will be coming” at Moscow’s chief Middle East ally. The presence of Russian troops and air defenses in Syria were among numerous complications weighing on Trump, who must also consider the dangers to roughly 2,000 American troops in the country if Russia were to retaliate for U.S. strikes.

Despite strong reservations expressed by some Democrats in Congress, the likelihood of Trump ordering a military strike seemed high given his public threats and indications from Britain and France that they, too, believe the Syrian government was behind the April 7 poison gas attack and must be penalized.

The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, based in the Netherlands, announced it would send a fact-finding team to the site of the attack outside Damascus. The team is due to arrive Saturday. It was not clear whether the presence of the investigators could affect the timing of any U.S. military action.

Three Democrats in the Senate, led by Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, sent a letter to Trump urging him to make a public and compelling legal case for any attack.

“This issue is of critical importance and the American people should be fully informed about your rationale for deploying American military power and the objectives of any U.S. military action in Syria,” Reed wrote, joined by Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois and Bob Menendez of New Jersey. “As previous commanders in chief have done in similar situations, we believe you should present a clear public articulation of these matters to the American people at the earliest appropriate time.”

The British Cabinet gave Prime Minister Theresa May the green light to join the U.S. and France in planning military strikes in Syria. She and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke separately with Trump on Thursday. Macron said France had proof the Syrian government launched chlorine gas attacks and his country would not tolerate it.

In Moscow, the Defense Ministry accused Britain of staging a fake chemical attack in Douma, a Syrian town outside Damascus. The incident a week ago, believed to have killed dozens of civilians, is the focus of international outrage and is the basis for Trump’s threat to unleash a missile barrage to punish the government of President Bashar Assad.

Britain called the Russian charge a “blatant lie.” Tensions between Moscow and London have escalated since the recent poisoning of a former Russian spy in Salisbury, England. Britain accused Moscow of ordering the poisoning; Moscow denies it.

The Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with Macron and the two leaders agreed to coordinate their actions to avoid further military escalation in Syria. It was unclear how this might influence the direction of events.

A day before a fact-finding team from the international chemical weapons watchdog was to arrive in Douma, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said images of victims of the purported attack were staged with “Britain’s direct involvement.” He provided no evidence.

As Trump deliberated, the Navy said the USS Winston S. Churchill, a destroyer armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles, was approaching the Mediterranean. It is joining the USS Donald Cook within range of Syria for potentially firing Tomahawks, which were the weapon of choice when the U.S. struck Syria in April 2017 to punish it for using chemical weapons. Navy submarines also are capable of firing Tomahawks; their movements are secret but they commonly operate in the Mediterranean.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was not seen publicly Friday, but he is known to argue for ensuring that military action in any context is linked to a broader political strategy. It’s unclear what policy the Trump administration is pursuing in Syria beyond fighting the Islamic State militants and hoping for a U.N.-brokered end to the civil war. In congressional testimony on Thursday, Mattis cited the risk of military action in Syria “escalating out of control.”

Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., told an emergency meeting of the Security Council that should the United States and its allies decide to act in Syria, it would be to defend “a bedrock international norm that benefits all nations” — the prohibition of the use of chemical weapons.

She said Friday that “the United States estimates that Assad has used chemical weapons in the Syrian war at least 50 times.”

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the Middle East is in such “peril” today that it has become a threat to international peace and security, and that Syria “represents the most serious threat.”

The U.S., France and Britain have been in extensive consultations about launching a military strike as early as the end of this week, U.S. officials have said. A joint military operation, possibly with France rather than the U.S. in the lead, could send a message of international unity.

FBI probing Michael Cohen’s ‘personal business dealings’,"NEW YORK (AP) — Federal prosecutors said in a court filing Friday that the criminal probe that led them to raid the offices of President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, is focused on the attorney’s “personal business dealings” and has been going on for months.

In the filing with a court in New York, prosecutors blacked out a section describing what laws they believe Cohen has broken, but they said the “crimes being investigated involve acts of concealment” and suspected fraud.

They also made clear that investigators have been gathering extensive evidence for some time as part of an ongoing grand jury investigation. Agents, they wrote, had already searched multiple email accounts maintained by Cohen after securing an earlier search warrant.

None of those emails, they added, was exchanged with Trump.

In a footnote, the prosecutors wrote that although the investigation was referred to prosecutors in New York by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, it was proceeding independently.

The U.S. Attorney’s office in Manhattan made the filing after lawyers for Cohen and Trump asked a judge to block the Justice Department from reviewing records seized Monday in FBI raids on Cohen’s apartment, hotel room, office and safety deposit box.

In a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood, Cohen’s lawyers asked to examine the seized documents and electronic devices. The lawyers said they should be allowed to identify which of the documents are protected by attorney-client privilege before prosecutors get to look at them.

An attorney for the president, Joanna Hendon, appeared as well, telling the judge that Trump has “an acute interest in these proceedings and the manner in which these materials are reviewed.”

“He is the president of the United States,” she said. “This is of most concern to him. I think the public is a close second. And anyone who has ever hired a lawyer a close third.”

But Assistant U.S. Attorney Tom McKay told the judge that he believed the proceedings were an attempt to delay the processing of materials seized in the search.

“The issues here are straightforward,” he said.

Of Trump, McKay said: “His attorney-client privilege is no greater than any other person who seeks legal advice.”

Federal agents seized records on a variety of subjects in raids Monday on Cohen’s Manhattan office, apartment and hotel room, including payments that were made in 2016 to women who might have damaging information about Trump.

The court hearing Friday didn’t provide new insight into why agents seized the items, but the judge, prosecutors and the attorneys all spoke openly about an investigation that previously has been shrouded in secrecy.

FBI and Justice Department officials have refused to say what crimes they are investigating, but people familiar with the investigation have told The Associated Press the search warrant used in the raids sought bank records, business records on Cohen’s dealing in the taxi industry, Cohen’s communications with the Trump campaign and information on payments made to a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, and a porn actress, Stephanie Clifford, who performs under the name Stormy Daniels. Both women say they had affairs with Trump.

Ordinarily, documents or communications seized from a lawyer by FBI agents would be reviewed by a team of Justice Department lawyers not directly involved in the investigation to determine which documents were relevant to the probe, and which should be off-limits to investigators because of attorney-client privilege.

The judge said prosecutors believed either a special “taint team” of government lawyers should decide what evidence can be properly viewed by criminal prosecutors. Or, they said, the court could appoint a special master for that purpose.

Hendon asked for a delay in court proceedings until at least Monday, saying she needed to research the law.

Clifford’s lawyer, Michael Avenatti, was in the audience for the court session and asked the judge to be heard at 2 p.m.

“We have every reason to believe that some of the documents seized relate to my client,” he said.

Cohen has denied wrongdoing.

Trump has called the raids a “witch hunt,” ”an attack on our country,” and a violation of rules that ordinarily make attorney client communications confidential.

Those confidentiality rules can be set aside under certain circumstances if investigators have evidence that a crime has been committed.

Public corruption prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan are trying to determine, according to one person familiar with the investigation, if there was any fraud related to payments to McDougal and Clifford.

McDougal was paid $150,000 in the summer of 2016 by the parent company of the National Enquirer under an agreement that gave it the exclusive rights to her story, which it never published. Cohen said he paid Daniels $130,000 in exchange for her silence about her claim to have had a one-night-stand with Trump.

The White House has consistently said Trump denies either affair.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Authorities say a woman who drove off California cliff last month in an SUV carrying her wife and children was drunk.

California Patrol Capt. Bruce Carpenter said Friday that toxicology tests found Jennifer Hart had an alcohol level of .102.

California drivers are considered drunk with a level of 0.08 or higher.

Carpenter says toxicology tests also found that her wife Sarah Hart and two of their adopted children had “a significant amount” of an ingredient commonly found in the allergy drug Benadryl, which can make people sleepy.

The Harts and three of their children were found dead after the car plunged into the Pacific Ocean on March 26

Two more are missing and another body has been found but not identified.

911: Man kills daughter who was also his wife after breakup,"NEW MILFORD, Conn. (AP) — A man killed his wife — who was also his daughter — and their 7-month-old son before taking his own life after the woman broke up with him, according to a 911 call.

Steven Pladl’s mother called police in North Carolina to say she’d had a disturbing call from her son and to ask officers to check on the well-being of her infant grandson.

The mother told police Pladl said he’d killed his baby in Knightdale, North Carolina, as well as his 20-year-old daughter and her adoptive father, who were shot in Connecticut. Pladl’s mother said he was upset because the woman had broken up with him. The slain infant had been born of the relationship between Steven Pladl and his daughter, Katie.

“I can’t even believe this is happening,” said Steven Pladl’s mother, whose name was redacted from the recording of the 911 call released by police in Cary, North Carolina.

The woman asked police to check on her grandson, Bennett Pladl. She said Steven Pladl had told her that he left a key under the front mat.

“He told me to call the police, that I shouldn’t go over there,” she said.

Police found the baby dead, alone in the house.

“We’re trying to make sense of all the factors that led up to this senseless taking of life,” Knightdale Police Chief Lawrence Capps said.

The 911 call came shortly after witnesses in rural western Connecticut reported hearing what sounded like semi-automatic gunfire Thursday morning. Inside a pickup truck with the window shot out police found the bodies of Katie Pladl and her adoptive father, Anthony Fusco, 56.

Pladl had contacted his daughter’s adoptive family in Wingdale, New York, on Wednesday night and said he would be coming to see them, according to Shawn Boyne, chief of police in New Milford, Connecticut. Katie Pladl and Fusco were shot as they were out running errands.

Police said Steven Pladl was later found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a minivan across the state line in Dover, New York.

Steven Pladl and Katie Pladl had been arrested on incest charges out of Henrico County, Virginia, in January.

Steven Pladl told his wife last year that he had impregnated their daughter and planned to marry her after obtaining a divorce, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch . As a child Katie Pladl had been adopted by a family out of state but after turning 18 she reached out to her birth parents through social media and began living with the family.

Attorney Rick Friedman, who had been representing Steven Pladl in the felony incest case, said he had breakfast with Pladl only a month ago and had no indication such violence was possible.

“This really bothers me a lot because nobody ever could have predicted this. If anybody had a remote idea anybody was in harm’s way there would have been no bond set,” he said. “There was just absolutely no prior notice anything would happen to these people.”

As part of the bond requirements, Friedman said, the father and daughter were not supposed to communicate with one another. He said Katie Pladl had been living in New York with her adoptive parents.

Officials in the resort town of Cancun reportedly responded to 14 murders in a 36-hour span.

The bloodbath was the result of six separate incidents that also left five additional people injured.

Although the violence is reported to be cartel-related, the executions occurred in close proximity to several popular tourist hotspots.

Nine people were killed on Wednesday, April 4 alone.

"End of world just days away, numerologist claims","(WHDH) — Author and Christian numerologist David Meade is again predicting the end of times. If his latest claim holds water, we have just days remaining on Earth.

The Earth will be destroyed on April 23 by a mysterious planet known as “Nibiru” or “Planet X,” according to Meade, who made a similar claim in 2017.

Meade’s theory is believed to be linked to the bible passage 12:1–2, which reads: “And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of 12 stars. She was pregnant and was crying out in birth pains and the agony of giving birth.”

Express reports that some conspiracy theorists believe “Virgo” is the woman from the passage.

“The sun and moon will be in Virgo, as will Jupiter, which represents the Messiah,” Meade told the news outlet.

Meade claims Planet X is on a collision course with Earth. He believes it will bring immense gravitational change, sparking huge volcanic eruptions and a catastrophic series of events.

“Thus the constellations Virgo, Leo and Serpens-Ophiuchus represent a unique once-in-a-century sign exactly as depicted in the 12th chapter of Revelation. This is our time marker,” Meade said.

NASA has previously said that Planet X does not exist, calling the theory a hoax.

“If Nibiru or Planet X were real and headed for an encounter with the Earth … astronomers would have been tracking it for at least the past decade,” NASA previously said.

"Hand dryers collect feces, spray them on you, study says","(WHDH) — Washing your hands is vitally important to your health, but a new study says you should avoid restroom hand dryers at all costs!

A study published by Applied and Environmental Microbiology says hand dryers suck up feces when toilets are flushed and then spray the bacteria all over your hands.

The study found that restrooms with hand dryers had up to 254 bacterial pathogens present.

“Bacteria in bathrooms will come from feces, which can be aerosolized a bit when toilets, especially lidless toilets, are flushed,” study author Peter Setlow told Newsweek.

According to the study, up to 60 bacteria colonies can be blown out of the dryer in a 30-second span.

Researchers say the hand dryers are not only just spreading bacteria to your hands. It’s also being spread to other areas.

“Within a large building, potentially pathogenic bacteria including bacterial spores may travel between rooms, and subsequent bacterial/spore deposition by hand dryers is a possible mechanism for spread of infectious bacteria including spores of potential pathogens if present,” the study said.

7 Investigates: Lights Out for Competitive Electric Suppliers in Mass.?,"(WHDH) — It could be lights out for third party residential electric suppliers in Massachusetts.

The state’s attorney general is calling for the industry to be shut down, saying some companies are using aggressive and deceptive sales tactics and offering false promises of cheaper bills.

It’s something 7 Investigates revealed just last month.

Kristin, Homeowner: “It’s so unfair.”

Kristin, a Middleborough homeowner, has the power of the state behind her.

She says she signed up for a third party electric provider which promised her savings, that she didn’t get.

Kristin: “I had a lock-in for 6 months and within 4 months they went up on our rates. I couldn’t get in touch with them.”

Just last month 7 Investigates’ Hank Phillippi Ryan spoke to homeowners who also had problems with these competitive suppliers. This man says he had his power provider changed without his authorization.

Hank: “What did you think?”

Homeowner: “I thought something was wrong.”

Hank’s investigation revealed the state received hundreds of complaints about third party energy suppliers. Something Attorney General Maura Healey acknowledged today:

Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healy: “I appreciate the reporting that’s been done on this issue, bringing attention to what’s happening out there.”

Healey says this new study shows during a two year period, Mass customers who signed up for third party electric providers paid $176 million more than if they had just stayed with their utility company.

Healey: “They aren’t protecting the public, they’re cheating the public.”

Some homeowners ended up paying between $230 to $500 more.

Healey: “We are gathered here today to take a stand against an industry that has abused and overcharged Massachusetts customers for way too long.”

And now the attorney general is calling to stop third party residential electric providers from operating in Massachusetts.

Healey: “We’ll be working to change the law to protect our residents. It’s time to stop the targeting, end the abuse and restore fairness.”

The attorney general’s proposed changes won’t impact third party commercial electric suppliers or cities and towns who purchase electricity for their communities. This does not affect third party gas suppliers.

Red Sox and Patriots players visit patients for One Boston Day,"BOSTON (WHDH) — Members of the Red Sox and Patriots got an early start on One Boston Day, visiting patients at several hospitals.

Dustin Pedroia and Rick Porcello visited patients at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Charlestown. The Red Sox stars posed for pictures and even brought along their World Series trophies. Over at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Brock Holt and Blake Swihart brought pizza and ice cream to the children at the Jimmy Fund Clinic. Coming along for the visit was Wally the Green Monster.

“This city has been through a lot over the past few years and it’s about sticking together and helping each other out and that’s kind of what life is about,” said Holt. “It’s about being there for each other and helping out when we can and that’s what we try to do.”

Patriots defensive lineman Deatrich Wise was also at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Friday. He stopped by the Kraft Family Blood Donor center to sign autographs and pose for pictures with patients and blood donors.

Solve It 7: Juicer,"(WHDH) — Bernard Washington loves juice.

His passion for pulp started decades ago, but really kicked into high gear about 10 years ago when he was watching TV one day.

He saw an infomercial featuring the famed fitness and nutrition expert Jack Lalanne, who he had always admired. Lalanne was showing off the latest juicer which beared his name and Bernard decided to give it a try.

“My lifestyle in general wasn’t conducive to eating properly,” explains the Boston mail carrier. “But I saw juicing as a way that I could make sure I have my proper nutrients available at all times.”

He’s been hooked ever since.

“I had more energy, definitely more revitalized,” Bernard says. “I just… I felt better.”

But his juicing journey hit a roadblock a little more than a year ago.

“It made this loud sound, like ‘Errrr.’ I didn’t know what it was,” he says. “I just examined it a little closer and it had cracked. The motor had cracked.”

His prized juicer was broken thanks to this motor mishap and it sat unusable on Bernard’s counter for months. Until he was watching TV again and saw another commercial.

“I noticed it said the motor had a lifetime warranty,” Bernard says. “I called and they said, ‘Yes it does!'”

Bernard packed up the juicer and sent it back to the company. A few days later, he went online and confirmed it was received.

“I went [online] and looked again and this time it says ‘order cancelled'” he says.

Shocked by what he saw, Bernard called the company and says the representative told him his order was being processed and he should be receiving it soon. But soon went from weeks to months.

“It’s like, wait a minute,” Bernard says. “You took my juicer, you took my money…I feel like I’ve lost.”

Bernard knew he needed help so he called Solve It 7.

We reached out to the juicer’s parent company and after some digging the representative figured out what happened.

Because of its age, Bernard’s model of juicer had been discontinued. That created an error in the computer system that automatically cancelled his replacement order.

The company rep called Bernard to personally apologize for the confusion. They sent him the latest model juicer along with a free set of copper cookware to make up for the mixup.

“If you see a problem and you can’t handle it and you don’t have the right connections, hey, Solve It 7 will help you,” says Bernard.

And if you need juice recipes, Bernard’s the man to ask. He’s now looking forward to his next juicing journey: potato juice!

A new Kardashian arrives as Khloe gives birth to daughter,"NEW YORK (AP) — Khloe Kardashian has given birth to a daughter with Cleveland Cavaliers player Tristan Thompson.

The Cavaliers said Thursday they have excused Thompson from practice for the birth of his daughter. Kardashian’s representatives have not commented on the birth, which was first reported by TMZ.

The birth comes amid a torrent of tabloid speculation about the couple after surveillance video showed the basketball star making out with other women. There has been no comment from either Kardashian or Thompson about the video.

It is Thompson’s second child and the first for Kardashian.

The “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” star has long talked about her desire to be a mother.

"Prosecutor: Milton teacher’s aide inappropriately touched girl in kindergarten class – Boston News, Weather, Sports","MILTON, MA (WHDH) - A Milton teacher’s aide charged with assaulting a kindergarten student has been ordered held on $10,000 bail.

John O’Connor, 55, of Milton, pleaded not guilty Friday to indecent assault charges in Quincy District Court.

The alleged incident happened last week inside a classroom at the Cunningham Elementary School. O’Connor was removed from the school after police say the victim told her mother about the alleged encounter.

O’Connor inappropriately touched the girl while the regular teacher was out of the classroom, according to a police report. Prosecutors say other students were present when the incident took place.

“He would review her work and she would be standing between his legs while he was sitting in the teacher’s chair. The desk and chair are facing the wall and other students would be sitting behind them. The other students could not see because they would be reading, according to the victim,” prosecutor Moira Daly said. “She says that sometimes he would touch her in the afternoon and when they were doing math centers in the class.”

Parents at the school say they are disgusted by the allegations, calling the incident “unacceptable.”

If O’Connor posts bail, a judge has ordered him to stay away from children under the age of 16. He is due back in court in June.

Jeff Bauman lives series of ups and downs in 5 years since bombings,"(WHDH) — He’s the man at the center of an image that came to symbolize the horror and heroism of that dark April day. Jeff Bauman, minutes from death. The photo captured a raw moment amid the terror, chaos and fear that engulfed the finish line at the 2013 Boston Marathon.

Bauman lost both legs in the marathon bombings. From his hospital bed he gave a description of one of the attackers that helped the FBI crack the case. Now five years later, the man who came to personify “Boston Strong” has gone through many changes, both good and bad.

Bauman and his then-companion Erin had a little girl named Nora in 2014.

“When I’m with her, I’m not really focused on anything else,” Bauman says in a recent sitdown interview with 7News’s Adam Williams. “It’s a good thing.”

In recent years, Bauman has gone back to school, studying engineering at Middlesex Community College.

“I really want to design prosthetics,” Bauman says. “I’m really into prosthetics and making the material and what goes into making my knees.”

Jeff’s story captivated Hollywood. His book “Stronger,” became a movie that drew A-list actor Jake Gyllenhaal to play his part.

But there have been dark times too.

Bauman says in the years after the bombings, his drinking got out of hand. Eventually he hit rock bottom.

“I really just tried to escape any way I could,” Bauman says. “Drinking was a quick fix for me and going out and partying.”

He says it ultimately cost him his marriage.

“Losing Erin in my life was extremely difficult. I knew I couldn’t just continue to drink and party and live like I was 21,” he says.

Bauman was able to get his life back on track. He’s almost two years sober and justifiably proud of it.

“I had to mature in the last two years and become a solid father and a solid person,” he says.

He’s been seeing a therapist who specializes in trauma and has been focusing on school and raising Nora.

When negative thoughts do creep in, he’s got a whole city of friends who have his back.

“I have great friends and a great support system,” Bauman says. “Everyone in Boston is a great support system.”

2014 Boston Marathon champ running to honor Martin Richard,"BOSTON (WHDH) — Meb Keflezighi brought Boston hope when he won the Boston Marathon a year after a terror attack shook the city. This year, he is running in honor of the 2013 attack’s youngest victim.

When Keflezighi won the race in 2014, he crossed the finish line and greeted the family members of 8-year-old Martin Richard, who was among the three people killed when two bombs erupted near the finish line.

In the years since the attack, Keflezighi said he has become good friends with the Richard family and even trades texts and emails to learn more about their son.

“Life is precious,” Keflezighi said. “You can’t bring Martin back but to have them there to be part of the event, to celebrate his life in a way, also.”

This year, Keflezighi will not be among the elite runners in this year’s marathon. Instead, he will join about 150 other people who will be running as part of Team MR8 in tribute to Martin.

“This year is pretty special, the fifth anniversary and honor him in a big way, hopefully,” Keflezghi said. “To be excited to be able to wear his jersey and represent the sport of running for something positive that he did.”

Watertown police officers recount 2013 shootout with marathon bombers,"WATERTOWN, Mass. (WHDH) — Though it looks like a neighborhood you could see anywhere, Laurel Street in Watertown is anything but.

It is the quiet residential neighborhood that five years ago was transformed into a war zone during a dramatic shootout between the Boston marathon bombers and local police officers.

“This is where I was shooting from,” Watertown Police Sgt. John MacLellan said on a recent afternoon, as he returned to the scene of the shootout with a 7News crew. He was standing in front of a small tree in someone’s front yard, hemmed in by a short fence.

“This tree seemed a lot bigger at the time,” he joked.

Today the street is calm, although remnants of the mayhem remain — bullet holes are still lodged in the siding of people’s homes. They serve as reminders for what transpired in the early morning hours of April 19, 2013.

MacLellan was one of the first officers to arrive on the scene after hearing about a carjacking in the area. Almost immediately, he found himself exchanging gunfire with the Tsarnaev brothers. The terrorists were armed with weapons including a gun, pipe bombs and pressure cookers.

“The first [bomb], my truck was rolling and it blew up on the other side of the car,” MacLellan says.

He was joined that night by veteran Watertown police officer, Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese. After close to 40 years on the force, not much phases Pugliese, who sports a long, white handlebar mustache. But no amount of time will wash away the memories he has here.

“When you drive down the street, you can’t help but think [about it],” Pugliese says. “I remember standing right over by that house there and exchanging gunfire six feet apart from the older brother.”

In his long policing career, the first time Pugliese ever fired his weapon was eye to eye with Tamerlan Tsarnaev.

The officers say they will remember so many who responded to the scene right along side them. But they don’t spend much time thinking about the two brothers who caused so much chaos.

“Unless I hear their names or somebody brings it up to me, they’re out of my mind,” says Pugliese. “They’re unimportant to me.”

What’s most important to them is the community they serve — the people who, since the shootout, show more gestures of appreciation.

“I’ll be standing in line at Dunkin’ Donuts to get a cup of coffee…the person two people ahead of me paid for it,” says Pugliese. “That never happened prior to this stuff.”

And they’ll never forget the heroism of their fellow officers that night on Laurel Street.

“All officers that were here that night did an outstanding job,” Pugliese says. “If one thing went another way, one of us might have been being buried that night. Or maybe more of us.”

Foundation dedicated to marathon bombing victim carries on her legacy,"BOSTON (WHDH) — Five years after she was killed in the Boston Marathon bombing, a foundation started by Lingzi Lu’s family and friends continues to help the city she loved so much.

Lu, 23, was a Boston University graduate student from China. On April 15, 2013 she was at the finish line to watch the Boston Marathon and was killed when the bombs exploded.

Lu’s family and friends said she was only in Boston for eight months but loved the city.

“That was her spirit, she wanted to be involved in the community of Boston. And she loved anything that brought people together,” said Meghan Zaremba of the Lingzi Foundation.

The Lingzi Foundation was established by Lu’s loved ones to support causes she loved. The non-profit has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for different groups, including Boston’s Police Athletic League. Each year, Team Lingzi runs the marathon in her honor. One of the runners this year is graduate student Adam Raphael.

“Her story kind of hit home with because she was a student,” said Raphael. “She was just out enjoying the day.”

This year, 12 people are running for Team Lingzi and they have raised more than $90,000 for the foundation.

"Historians: Civil War statues need context, should be moved","RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — As North Carolina grapples with whether to move three Confederate monuments from the state Capitol grounds, two historians are advising that they should be moved — but if that can’t happen, some historical context should be added so people can learn from the past.

“It would seem those monuments to the Confederacy are as public a statement as can possibly be made about who and what North Carolina is,” wrote David Blight, a history professor at Yale University. “If it is possible to move them to a prominent place that would allow their interpretation as part of Southern, American and North Carolina history, it would seem to me to be a good idea. But don’t erase them from the landscape. Replace, but learn. Relocate but do not lose the lessons.”

Meanwhile, a legal analysis by the UNC School of Government indicates that altering a statue by providing a plaque or other addition with historical context might be easier than moving the monuments.

Blight, who has written multiple books on the Civil War and its aftermath, was responding to a committee appointed by the state’s Historical Commission to consider Gov. Roy Cooper’s request to remove the monuments to Bentonville battlefield in Johnston County.

Sheffield Hale, president and chief executive officer of the Atlanta History Center, wrote that context should be added whether the monuments are moved or not. He wrote that it “must acknowledge slavery as the primary cause of the Civil War and explain how monuments promoted the myth of the Lost Cause and the practice of Jim Crow segregation.”

The panel plans to report on the proposal to the full state commission, possibly in May. The commission must then decide whether to move the monuments.

The committee received almost 7,000 public comments ahead of a Thursday deadline. It is still awaiting a legal analysis from the state attorney general’s office.

Two events prompted Cooper’s request that the statues be moved: a violent rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which one protester was killed, and the toppling of a Confederate statue outside a Durham County government building by demonstrators. But a state law approved by the Republican-controlled General Assembly in 2015 prevents the permanent removal of most Confederate monuments — described as “objects of remembrance” — on state and local property without legislative approval. It also severely limits their relocation.

Hale, of the Atlanta History Center, reviewed the history of each of the three monuments erected decades after the end of the Civil War: the Capitol Confederate Monument, dedicated in May 1895; the Henry Lawson Wyatt Monument, dedicated in June 1912; and the North Carolina Confederacy Monument, dedicated in June 1914.

All three “express Lost Cause sentiments” and carry different meaning from those built shortly after the end of the Civil War to commemorate the dead, he writes.

“Removing these monuments would not erase Civil War history — if any history is in danger of being erased, it is the history of institutionalized white supremacy found in the Jim Crow era,” Hale writes. “There is an argument to be made that these monuments, properly contextualized, can help educate the public about that difficult history.”

On the legal side, an assistant professor at the UNC School of Government advised that the Historical Commission has authority to approve the relocation of the three monuments, but only under the narrow criteria of the 2015 law, which include that that move is necessary to preserve the object or that it’s necessary because of construction.

The commission also may approve or deny requests to alter the monuments, the brief says, and re-interpretation likely falls into that category. However, a monument can’t be altered to the point that it loses its “commemorative nature,” it says.

Body cam footage captures legally blind woman’s rescue from burning home,"MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (WSVN) – Body camera footage captured the heart-stopping moment when two Miami Beach Police officers raced into a burning home to rescue a legally blind woman who was unable to escape.

The footage shows Miami Beach Police K-9 Officer Alex Llaneras and Officer Ralph Vera at the front door the home of 62-year-old Shelley Spitz, located along Post Avenue, just after midnight, Monday.

The officers can then be seen talking to Spitz’s husband, as he was able to safely evacuate the residence.

“Come on out, come on out, come on out!” one of the officers can be heard telling the homeowner.

“Is there anybody else in the house?” one of the officers can be heard asking the resident.

The footage then shows the officers making their way inside the smoky home.

“Where are you?” Spitz can be heard saying before she coughs.

“I said, ‘Help me, help me.’ I couldn’t find the way out,” Spitz told 7News during an interview on Monday afternoon.

“Come on out! Follow the lights!” said one of the officers as held a flashlight.

One of the officers can be heard coughing as he continues walking further into the house.

“I think it was one of the policemen who came, and he extended his hand in the middle of the hallway,” said Spitz. “He grabbed my hands, and he led me out.”

The video then shows one of the officers grabbing Spitz by her hand and helping her out of the house.

“Just you two, correct?” an officer can be heard asking.

“Step outside, step outside,” one officer can be heard saying as Spitz walks out her front door.

The fire started in Spitz’s kitchen.

She said she was asleep when she awoke to the smoke.

Her husband was able to make it out safely, but she was disoriented and trapped.

“I’m feeling extremely lucky under the circumstances, loved by God,” she said, “because if God didn’t love me, he wouldn’t have woken me up.”

As the officers pulled Spitz outside, she can be heard saying, “I’m sorry.”

“That’s what I’m here for,” replied one of the officers. “That’s why God put me on this planet.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Paul Ryan is backing Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy as his successor.

In an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Ryan says McCarthy is “the right person.”

“I think Kevin is the right guy to step up,” Ryan says in the interview that will air Sunday.

The endorsement comes after Ryan stunned Washington this week by announcing he would not seek another term in Congress this fall.

Ryan’s retirement, as Republicans fight to keep the House majority in this year’s midterm elections, has sparked a potentially bruising leadership battle between California Rep. McCarthy, who is next in line, and the No. 3 ranking Republican, Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, who has more support from conservatives. McCarthy backed out of a leadership race three years ago amid similar divisions.

GOP Senator says Trump vows to protect marijuana industry,"DENVER (AP) — A Republican senator says President Trump has promised to support legislation protecting the marijuana industry in states that have legalized the drug.

Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner says Trump made the pledge to him in a Wednesday night conversation. Gardner has been working on bipartisan legislation to prevent prosecution of people who obey marijuana laws in states like Colorado.

Though some use of marijuana has been legalized in 24 states, the drug is illegal under federal law.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions in January rescinded Obama-era protections that limited federal prosecutions of people in states where marijuana was legal. Gardner in response used his power in the Senate to stop consideration of new nominees to the Department of Justice.

Gardner says he will now allow those nominations to proceed.

Trump pardons former Cheney aide Scooter Libby,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump issued a full pardon Friday to I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby, a former top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney.

Trump said he does not know Libby, but “for years I have heard that he has been treated unfairly. Hopefully, this full pardon will help rectify a very sad portion of his life,” according to a statement issued by White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders announcing the pardon.

Libby, Cheney’s former chief of staff, was convicted of lying to investigators and obstruction of justice following the 2003 leak of the covert identity of CIA officer Valerie Plame. President George W. Bush later commuted Libby’s 30-month prison sentence, but didn’t issue a pardon despite intense pressure from Cheney. No one was ever charged for the leak.

Since then, the Libby case has been criticized by conservatives, who argue he was the victim of an overly zealous and politically motivated prosecution by a special counsel. Another twist is that the special counsel, Patrick Fitzgerald, was appointed by James Comey, deputy attorney general at the time. Comey later became head of the FBI, but was fired by Trump, and has since written a book highly critical of the president.

White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, while declining at the time to confirm Trump’s plans for a pardon, said earlier Friday that “many people think that Scooter Libby was the victim of a special counsel gone amok.” Asked if a pardon would be about Comey, Conway said no.

Plame appeared on MSNBC Friday morning and said a pardon would send a message “that you can commit crimes against national security and you will be pardoned.”

The pardon was the third for Trump. He granted one last year for former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was awaiting sentencing for contempt of court. Trump also pardoned a U.S. Navy sailor, who was convicted after taking photos of classified portions of a submarine.

Conservative criticism of the special counsel in the Plame case echoes critiques of Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading an investigation into Russian election interference, possible coordination with Trump associates and potential obstruction of justice by the president. Trump has called that probe a “witch hunt.”

Solder finished with saying that he learned a lot about life over the last seven years and a lot about winning – mostly that winning is not everything.

One night after the benches cleared twice and the longtime rivals brawled during New York’s 10-7 win, there were no such incidents in the finale of the three-game set. Boston slugger Hanley Ramirez departed with a bruised wrist after he was hit by a pitch in the first, but everyone stayed in their respective dugouts.

Bruins beat Maple Leafs 5-1 in opener of playoff series,"BOSTON (AP) — Sean Kuraly isn’t so good at waiting.

The Boston Bruins forward is usually going full-speed on the ice, whether it’s chasing the puck on the forecheck or sizing up an opponent for a hit. So when he saw David Pastrnak’s shot hit off the post and flutter into the air, it was tough for Kuraly to be patient.

“A play like that doesn’t come around very often. When it does, it’s kind of a waiting game,” he said on Thursday night after bunting the puck into the net to help the Bruins beat Toronto 5-1 in the opener of their first-round Eastern Conference playoff series.

“It’s not really my style,” said Kuraly, who had to resist hitting the puck before it fell below the level of the crossbar to avoid being called for a high stick. “To go from 100 mph and hitting everything that moves and (wait) in front of the net, it can be a challenge.”

Brad Marchand, David Backes and David Krejci each scored a power-play goal, and Tuukka Rask stopped 26 shots for Boston. Pastrnak scored to make it 3-1 with 38 seconds left in the second period, then moved in on goalie Frederik Andersen seven minutes into the third before backhanding the puck off the post.

Kuraly waited, and then two-handed the puck off the shaft of his stick like a bunt as he fell over the sprawling goalie.

“I’m a terrible baseball player,” he said. “It has nothing to do with baseball.”

Game 2 of the best-of-seven series is back at the TD Garden on Saturday night.

“We’ve got a day to solve our problems,” Toronto coach Mike Babcock said. “We could feel sorry for ourselves if we want tonight, but that’s a waste of time and energy.”

Boston already scored two power-play goals when Toronto’s Nazem Kadri was thrown out of the game and given a five-minute major for an elbow to Tommy Wingels’ head. Three-minutes later, Krejci bounced it in off Andersen from behind to make it 5-1.

“I thought it was the appropriate call,” Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. “Where it goes from here is out of my hands.”

Zach Hyman scored Toronto’s only goal, and Andersen made 35 saves.

“They cranked it up, and we didn’t answer,” defenseman Ron Hainsey said.

The matchup is the first in the postseason for the teams since Toronto’s Game 7 collapse in the first round in 2013, when Boston rallied from a 4-1 deficit in the third period, scoring twice in the last 82 seconds of regulation to send it into overtime. The Bruins went on to reach the Stanley Cup Finals.

The Maple Leafs never had a lead to blow in this one.

And the Boston power play was the reason.

“Obviously, our penalty kill wasn’t good enough,” Babcock said. “We took too many penalties in the third, and the third was no contest.”

With James Van Riemsdyk off for hooking, Marchand scored on a backhander to give the Bruins the lead 5:28 into the game. Hyman tied it for the Leafs with about three minutes before the break but Backes put Boston back in front early in the second on a pass from Krejci.

Pastrnak converted a pass from Marchand with 38 seconds left in the period to make it 3-1, and then set up the next goal when he moved in on Andersen and bounced it off the post. As the puck fluttered in the air over the sprawled goalie, Kuraly came in trailing the play and knocked it into the net.

NOTES

Pastrnak and Torey Krug had two assists apiece. … Toronto was 0-for-3 on the power play. Boston was 3-for-6. … The teams came into the game 34-34-1 in their first 69 playoff matchups, but the Maple Leafs hold an 8-6 series edge. … The Bruins pledged the profits of their 50/50 raffle — at least $50,000 — to support the victims of the Humboldt Broncos hockey team bus crash.
